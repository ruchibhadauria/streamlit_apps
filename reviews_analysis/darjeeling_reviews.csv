The property is a bit isolated and hence one cannot think to step out to the local markets or places at night without a car.  3. The garden area or the Kanchenjunga view point was not cleaned at all.

I had last visited here 18 years ago, with my parents. So obviously the entire stay was very nostalgic as well.  Since I am a pilot, I spend half of my life in hotels all over Asia.

We stayed in their basic rooms - spacious enough to accommodate 2 people..  Most of their rooms offer a good valley view and they've got AC's in their rooms which works as a heater (a good thing to bear the cold weather of Darjeeling)  Very quick room service and staff is courteous enough to treat you well.  Restaurant has got both veg and non veg meal options.  In case of not so full occupation of property and your meal is included in your booking they offer an ala carte option for your meal, hence no need to worry about buffet system.

"My wife and I, accompanied by another couple, drove in our car from Kolkata to Darjeeling and spent 3 nights here from 14 to 17 Sep 2020. The resort had just reopened after many months of Covid-19 lockdown but the staff was completely ready to look after us properly with all sanitization and hygiene protocols in place. Being the first and only guests after a long closure, we received highly personalized and royal treatment.  The weather was foggy, overcast and wet during our entire stay and therefore we could not view the mountains. But the ambience of this resort, friendly and supportive staff and good food more than made up for it. I must make special mention of the manager Mr. Rajesh who went out of the way to make us comfortable.

"This is a property that is set apart from the rest (quite literally!) as it is not in the main town of Darjeeling but in the highest town in the region (approx. 7400 feet) in Ghum around 8 km from the Darjeeling mall. Though this brings with it some minor hurdles of heading to the main mall area every time you want to go to town, it also gives you that feel of exclusivity and seclusion, a trait sadly that is all but disappearing from most hill station stays with each passing day.   It is lovely to visit the old, original Ghum Monastery and the Heritage train station especially in the mornings. We loved walking down to the station every day and spending some quiet, meditative time at the monastery. Shows you a different side of Darjeeling...

This is an original Sterling property that has been renovated very well. The location is splendid and one can see the Kanchenjunga from the resort itself. The staff was one of the most hospitable and helpful I have seen in Sterling. The food was limited and the buffets were disappointing both in terms of variety and taste.  We chose room service which was good.The upkeep is very good and my compliments to Sterling for having restored it so well. We came back after many years and had a wonderful time. A couple of advisories to sterling members a) Bring or hire small vehicles as the approach road is very narrow b) Book a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment as the compacts have no views.,Date of stay: March 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The rooms are well maintained and amazing ly helpful staff. I wanted to shift my room and they did it with a smiling face.  Kanchenjunga viewpoint was just awesome. I was lucky enough to view the full moon setting on one side and sun rising  on the other. It was just breathtaking. Persons like  us who can't move much can enjoy kanchenjunga here.

We found Sterling Darjeeling to offer the best service in a very standard price. It was a good deal for us hence we booked .  But realised by staying how a hotel can give a comfort of a home.we would probably be ready to pay some extra to get that comfort in future.  This was our first trip in India as a married couple. Team of Sterling and the manager made sure that we get the treatment of a honeymooning couple in a overnight notice.  The team was prompt in serving from the basics to any requirements we came with.

Right from checking in everything was quick and well coordinated. A couple of minutes was all it took to be in the room. The restaurant was another great experience. Both veg and nonveg items were superb, both in taste and quantity. Restaurant was absolutely value for money besides giving a great dining experience.

It's suggested to carry basic amenities for yourself specially if you are accompanied with a child.  Better to go to Darjeeling for your meals so that you don't have to wait for an hour to be offered a meal which is not edible (both in terms of taste as well as quality).  Property seems to be good but not at all maintained. You can find lots of spider web on the way to your room. You can also find them in your rooms as well.

I spotted at least fifteen species of beautiful birds while strolling around the resort. The pair of binoculars we debated on while packing for this trip was a great decision. We did short treks each day into the almost pristine tracks around the resort, a far cry from the bumper-to-bumper traffic on the regular roads between Ghoom (where the resort is located) and Darjeeling.

Disappointing with sterling. First being a member with them they don't give you what they would give if you book as a paid guest through an online portal.

I had to compulsorily take a smaller size unit. Then at the resort the location of the unit was not at all good. Most time was wasted on the day of check in following up with the reception and later at the call center which reluctantly connected me to the manager (guruprasad)who accepted sterlings mistake while booking and also gave me a reference number 04438727 but couldn't upgrade me at the moment.

I recently stayed in the Darjeeling resort from May 31 to April 4. My room no was 1109. The resort is in excellent location in Ghum and is very well maintained. The room was comfortable and the service by the entire staff was top class. Housekeeping needs special mention and was as good as any 5 star hotel in the world. Food and the F & B restaurants were also very impressive and the cuisine was excellent and they obliged wholeheartedly and prepared any dish as per our requirements . I would like to compliment your managers Mainak Mitra and Rajesh for being available always to help us out. I congratulate and thank each one out there for making our stay a memorabe one.

"The hotel is located in Ghoom in interior,  the approach is congested and road in dire need of repair. The hotel is 8-10 kms away from mall road and major attractions in the hill station.  If you don’t have your own conveyance, then you have no option but to depend on hotel for arranging cabs. The cabs arranged by the hotel are in bad condition, charge exorbitantly and the driver’s high headedness will make you question your choice of destination. The breakfast served by hotel is below average, no one to attend and the staff is not acquainted with simple things. The club room where we stayed, was poorly maintained and had a aweful approach.

The rooms have been beautifully refurbished and the warmth of the courteous old staff help to make you immediately feel at home.  The main drawbacks are a couple of ""non""value-for-money items, as follows :-  1. Transportation cost from/to resort to/from Darjeeling town is prohibitively priced currently at Rs.400/- ""each way"" for a small taxi ( ok if there are 4 people but expensive if one is alone or a couple ). The resort could arrange for a drop-off/pick-up on sharing-basis to make this cost-effective.  2. Food is expensive & the quality has somewhat deteriorated in the last 4 years.

His answer was we do not clean with any wet mop. Linen & towels are bad. Sofa bed was stinking. No continuous hot water. Geyser of limited capacity that takes 25min to get ready. Imagine if you have leave early and get ready quickly, we were forced to take bath in freezing cold water. Be-ware!!

"Excellent place to stay in Darjeeling, away from the city but minus point is that the approaching road to this place is very narrow and highly populated as the resort is around one kilometre from the main road. After sunset or in the dark it appears that it is not safe to have a walk in this street. One have to take dinner inside the resort and can not think of walk around any other place. Inside resort, there is a good gaming area where one can enjoy carom, table tennis, chess, other games and karoke. One can do gym, can  have good Kanchenzonga view from this resort, good spacious dining area is there, ample parking area. Good place to stay near the nature",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Honestly the place is situated at a great location but the approach road is bad. They have tried hard to centrally maintain the temperature but the rooms become over claustrophobic because of the leakage even if you keep your AC off. On top of that their is no ventilation in the rooms, so finally you will get up middle of the night panting and sweating! Oxygen level drops in the rooms because of no ventilation. Then you try their cottage, which are beautiful and should be tried definitely. A suggestion from my end, please provide oil heaters in your cottage and you shall rock. But they definitely should do something about their main hotel building. The AC heating system SUCkKs!  With all this problem, the staff is very cordial and very adjusting.

"I visited Darjeeling for two days from 31.10.2018 and decided to stay away from hustle and bustle of Darjeeling proper. So Sterling Resort ( named Darjeeling Kush Alaya) at Ghoom, about 8 kms. away from mall of Darjeeling was my choice by default. Now I am feeling proud that I made one of the best decisions of my life. Situated on the lap of historical Ghoom monastery, my new home for two days were beyond my expectations. The room my family was allotted was a two-storied suit with all separated and fully furnished drawing room and dining room in the ground floor and two fully furnished separate bed rooms in the upper floor. To my utter surprise Mt. Kanchenjunga was visible throughout the day from sunrise almost from every corner of one room, that too fitted with a balcony.

"This is an excellent resort at Ghoom,which is around 8km from Darjeeling main town. The view id excellent though most part of the day the clouds descend upon the resort and make the visibility close to ne negligible. The buffet spread is excellent too. The only drawback of this place is the access road to the resort. It is very narrow and bumpy. Rooms are neat and clean.",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"To start with,this particular resort is located in a very inconspicous turn on the main road to Darjeeling.The hotel doesnot even mind to put a signboard on the turn.We were alloted a room in Hillary which offers no view and is a bit small.The restaurant menu disappointed us.There is not much options to choose from the a la carte menu for lunch and evening snacks apart from the fact that they take more than an hour to deliver the food to your room.The breakfast buffet spreads were better than the dinner.We generally go on vacation twice a year and had stayed in other 4 star properties as well but this particular stay has been very uncomfortable.

The rooms are small, there is no great view either but had all the necessary amenities that you would expect. Our room had a heating problem owing to which we had a terrible first night because it was quite cold. The second night the offered us a extra heater because they couldn't fix their central heating. Food is pricy but well made and served. Breakfast spread was delightful and sumptuous.

Windows fixed so unable to ventilate rooms.Buildings sitting on hillside not unlike Shimla but less buildings and more Darjeeling tea).Air con probably did not help and yet again we never seem to make the place any warmer. Need to use laundry facilities in hotels as you cannot wash and dry smalls.

"The resort staff was extremely cooperative and helpful thet tried their level best to manage things i required but there is some improvement needed on the part of sterling management to be best in customer satisfaction level. As a member of sterling I will suggest following improvements: 1. Resort is situated at distant from core of Darjeeling i.e. - mall road, so company should provide free pick n drop. 2. Members spent a long vacation there with their family and all so their rooms should be equipped with mini kitchen. 3. A small general store for daily needs should be in premises. 4.

The room was good, but the wifi poor. You only receive one hour of free wifi for the whole of your stay, and you can only use it on one device, which is quite mean on a 4-5 star hotel. The food was reasonable, but I was down for breakfast at 8.15 am, and a lot of the selections had been taken, or were not hot. The evening meals were good.

People in Darjeeling seem kinder, happier with inherent congeniality which I find lacking in the cities. I don’t know if it’s the serenity of hills, the clean air and the  calm and cool environment which makes the difference but there is a definite difference. The room was impeccable and beautiful. The decor was tasteful and the whole suite was very comfortable. Food too was very good though a little expensive.

The studio room size is quite decent, can accommodate a couple with small kids comfortably. The food quality is good and affordable. Most importantly— the support staff at the front desk, housekeeping and restaurants is very simple, courteous and supportive. I would like to make a special mention of Mr Pemba Sherpa, the Sr. FO executive.

The evening was full of fog in and around hotel. They have cottages as well as rooms, though we stayed in a decent room but would strongly recommend to take cottages as they have a better view as well as a better experience. The icing on cake was their games room where we had an interesting session of table tennis which was quite refreshing. There is Carom, Air Hockey, PS4, and Ludo, i.e. something or the other for everyone. The breakfast was one of the best that we had during our complete trip.

But this time, we decided to take a chance after reading several reviews. We are sterling members. But in the past 6 years, we have completely avoided staying at sterling because the resorts had become rundown and poorly maintained.

"Located at Ghoom, the Sterling resort in Darjeeling is away from the crowded Darjeeling town. The big attraction, of course, is that the resort has its very own view point from where one can see the magnificent Kanchenjunga. Unfortunately, for us, we were unable to take advantage of that as we vacationed during the onset of the monsoon. That, however, had it's own charm with the mist surrounding the Darjeeling hills and the resort. Sterling offers comfortable accommodation, good food and warm service.

Staff is helpful and as usual the location is the key.   The entry to the location is very narrow and you have to pray that your vehicle does not get stuck, but the location and the place and the drivers are tuned to this and they are very skilled most of them to negotiate this.  …",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Resort is located in Ghoom few kms away from darjeeling. Location is good. Offers a good view of mountain ranges. Interiors are nicely done and you feel great as you enter the reception area. The rooms are nicely done and offer refrigerator and microwaves in cottages. Service team does excellent work and are always available. The food quality is also great. Travel desk is also helpful although a bit expensive. One more attraction is Amit's Shop selling woolens inside hotel. It gives you a good collection and that too at market price.,Date of stay: April 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Understaffed and understocked resturant and bar with poor quality food.  Front desk and room service are almost always busy to take your calls.  Location is good if you want to spend most of your time at Ghum monastery but it’s far from Darjeeling city Center.  Overall staff is cold or clueless. Only saving grace is the house keeping service with prompt and polite staff.   Sterling resorts ? Not again !,Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

We were a group of 12 ( 6 couples) friends and stayed at the much hyped sterling resort. The resort is situated far away from Darjeeling in a place called ghoom.

"The resort is relatively modern, clean, and quiet. There's an excellent view of Mt Kanchenjunga right from the hotel - so if you're planning to go a Kanchenjunga sunrise tour - reconsider! The view at Sterling is just as good, without the huge crowds of tourists. We had both breakfast and dinner at the hotel - the food was good, a big buffet selection, Western prices. Here's the thing: we went in the middle of winter, and the rooms were cold. There was a small electric heater in my room which was woefully inadequate for winter, and the hot water only ran hot for a few minutes, so you can forget about long luxurious hot showers.

Food: Slightly above average, the breakfast spread is quite diverse and they do change it, so its not the same everyday Service / Staff: Staff at the restaurant were ok, room service was bad, I had a leaking faucet which I asked them to fix, even on the third day, it was still leaking and with temperatures at 6 degrees its not cool (no pun intended) to step in a a puddle of water.",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

I remember 2-3 rooms, where you can have this view directly from the Balcony      itself. If you are staying here, I think you can easily avoid a trip to Tiger Hills. 2) There is a Monastery nearby to this resort, where you can visit. 3) If you are planning for the Darjeeling Toy train, I would strongly recommend you to      take the trip from Darjeeling station to Ghum station (means take only one side      journey and avoid the round trip). Ghum station is walkable distance from Sterling      and can save some bucks by doing so. 4) There are many activities available like Carrom board, TT and so on. 5) The staff’s were really good and…",Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

There is a gym / spa and a very beautifully designed restaurant that offers nice view of Himalayan snow peaks.

The cottages are quite large with a living space and a bed room with a balcony. Quality of food was excellent. The staff were courteous and helpful.

Do choose the place if you are traveling by a car. It is far away from the hustle of the town yet a quick tour by the car or even by the toy train. Local settlements are everywhere and pretty often you shall come across the small shops selling tea or local vegetables. Breakfast could include a bit of meaty options.

Darjeeling is over hyped and getting in and out of town is a night mare with traffic jams all over the place. So it was good we were out of that madness. We needed to unwind after a stressful all days (8 days) driving tour of Sikkim ending here. Reception is very welcoming ... Staff is amazing... We loved it even more because we had booked 2 studio rooms, for us and when we reached none were available. So they upgraded us to 2 BHK townhome style cottage.

"We checked into the Privileged Suites for a three night stay in Darjeeling. The Best part is that not is out of town and all the places that we need up visiting, Tiger Hill, Mirik Lake, Pashupati Market, etc is close from this resort as it is located on Ghoom about 8 Km out of Darjeeling. The weather was awesome for May as it was misty and Cold. the Ghoom Monastery, is like next door and we ca  actually walk to it from the resort.  The food is descent but the service tends to be slow as the hotel was sold out. We chose to eat Ala carte for all our meals at the hotel.

We were booked for a 2 bhk suite but landed up getting a 1 bhk and the most important thing was the interaction with the staff there.The manager was extremely rude something that goes against the industry that he is serving. The hotel however is well made and maintained but again the food quality is in no comparison to any standard hotels.The location being about 5km from the mall road conveyance becomes expensive as one needs to shell from 800-1000 k for thru n fro journey.hence I would suggest in the same amount that you shell for this hotel(unless a member) planning and booking a hotel on the mall road is a better bet.,Date of stay: May 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

We were guests of Sterling members and this resort turned out to be the better one of their property. The room was ok as we got one at the bottom away from the main building. Please ask for room near main building which are more private and has better views. We did not have a view from our room and the trek to the main building was tiring. The food was ok in the buffet but the manager in the restaurant was very polite and made for the average food.

"Its a huge trap, do not go there unless you are a Sterling holidays member. Once you are inside the resort you can not dare to venture out of the premises without shelling out a minimum of INR 1000 for a taxi ride to Darjeeling mall. The resort is reached after a sudden swift turn between some grocery shops after Ghum railway station. Its near to Ghum monastery. Unless you are being driven by a local driver its very difficult to turn the lane after the railway station. The road is terrible and dirty.

The hotel has good views of the Kangchenjunga mountains provided the weather is clear.  They have a very good play area which keeps children occupied. The food was decent as well. Its walking distance from Ghoom monestary.  Only con would be that the darjeeling city is not very closeby.

Sight-seeing from rooms was beautiful as it was completely surrounded by Mountains. Best thing is that they have plenty of games for kids in which kids can enjoy.  Location: From a point of view of sight seeing, location was awesome, but if you a person who likes to roam around in local market in evening time after your travel, this is not that kind of place. You can find a small market nearby for some basic stuff but there is no big market as it is in some outer part of Darjeeling.

"A quiet and refreshing vacation in the hills will not be complete, perhaps, without a proper accommodation. This property of Sterling is located away from the crowd of Darjeeling and thus scores in the first place by providing a peaceful stay. If you are travelling from NJP station, the pre-paid cab would charge you Rs. 1760 for a trip up to Darjeeling and you will have to bargain separately with the allotted driver for de-touring to Ghum. They will ask you for Rs. 2000 to be dropped at Ghum. Please remember that while climbing uphill, Ghum comes 6 KM (approx) earlier than Darjeeling and hence bargain to not to pay more for taking you to Ghum instead of Darjeeling.

We  stayed at the resort from 15 -16 April 2017. It is shabby and horrible. Rooms and furniture are full of dust. Housekeeping does not believe in cleaning the rooms even after a day's stay - you get soiled room after you come back from the day sightseeing. Towels were stained. Restaurant staff had to be pushed to clear the tables and set up for us. Toilet door does not close unless you slam it hard. Room with a view had tall trees to cover the view!

"Being a member of Streling for more than 25 years, the more resorts of Sterling I visit lately the more I feel the title, ""Miss the Good 'Ol Sterling"". No doubt the resorts are refurbished, no doubt the accommodations are better and the list of places is growing. But the hospitality seems to be losing the friendliness and seems to be getting more professional. Like one of the front-desk employees at this resort said ""Its Business"". So here's my experience of this resort.  Since my family became of member of Sterling we had selected Darjeeling as our base for the timeshare but never got to visit it.

"A neat hotel with very well done up rooms with microwave and kitchenette. Good service and courteous staff. Excellent view of Kanchenjunga esp on a clear day from the Hotel itself!  F&B is great especially the Buffet. Hats off to Mr. Bhim Singh, the F&B consultant for his personal touch and for meeting guests at every meal!  The meal pricing is the BIG negative - a rip off!   Good in house games and recreational activities for kids.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"This is one of the finest report of sterling. Its located conveniently near to Ghoom station and at the resort gate itself you will find the Ghoom monastery. (Darjeeling city is around 8 KM from the resort)  The resort and its rooms are well designed and makes the stay enjoyable, the staff are properly trained to take care of all guest requirements.  Menu and the food is at the best, the staff are well trained and takes care of the guest very well. All management is approachable and they put their best effort if any concern is raised to them…  The resort has a spot from were you can have the Kanchenjunga mt view and need not go to tiger hill at 4 in the morning :) during our visit all the rooms facing the mountain was under renovation but all other room has equally good  valley…",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We were a group of six. It was a long ride from the Bagdogra Airport..it was dark when we landed up...but the well-lit resort was very welcoming. The rooms were spacious..however the kitchenette provided needs to be revamped. How does one cook any meal with just a microwave ..at least a hot plate would be welcome. Please add a hot plate for the convenience of guests ( If the Management reads this?) Otherwise...the front desk staffers were very helpful and arranged the tourist car driver...   . Dawa was efficient and we took him for our long trips to Kalimpong and the Nepal border...he was uncomplaining,,deft at driving  besides he spoke reasonable good english a real boon.

We were lucky enough to get a room facing the Kanchan Junga. The hotel is a few kms away from Darjeeling in Ghoom and has very narrow approach. Though once you reach the hotel everything is fine.

"The hotel is near the Ghoom monastery and the railway station. There is no signage at the entrance road to the hotel which needs to be put up. While travelling from Darjeeling you are bound to miss the entrance road. The best landmark is the school and the ""kirana"" shop where Glenarys confectioner is written. The view from the hotel is fantastic but probably none of the rooms have mountain view. The breakfast spread is good with tasty and nice food and a beautiful view of the Kanchenjunga from the dining hall/restaurant. The lunch and snacks was also good. The old monastery is just by the side of the hotel a nice little walk. It was a pleasant stay for us. The sunrise from this hotel is great and on a clear day magnificent.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"You realize the mistake you have made just as soon as you take a left turn on the most narrowest roads in Ghoom. The property itself is nothing much to write home about. The staff is not what a Sterling property should have. The rooms are dirty, linens unchanged, no view of any sort from the room, All I can say is that I had booked and paid for 4 nights and I checked out after staying for one day and the manager did not have the courtesy to ask why was I checking out early and was there any other way that they could make my stay more comfortable. In short the worst property of Sterling that I have stayed in and my advice is to avoid this property as a plague.",Date of stay: November 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

"The entrance through Ghoom village was making us apprehensive but the moment we reached the resort we were pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and promptly changed our room when we so requested. The property is currently under expansion and renovation. The walls outside our room were painted while we were out for lunch but unfortunately the area was not cleaned for two days. The travel desk was prompt and helpful. The Spa is open only till 6 pm with the result that it becomes difficult for tourists to avail of it. The Executive Chef, Mr. Uttam and his staff took special care by making dishes out of the menu and doing a brilliant job. I am reserving my best experience for the end as it was an unforgettable one.

"Before we checked in to the hotel, we had read some negative reviews and we were a bit skeptical on how it will actually turn out to be.   But staying here for 2 nights was a delightful experience in all aspects, be it the rooms, food or facilities.  Looks like the management has taken good view of the concerns raised by earlier visitors and made efforts to fix them, which in itself is very heartening!  Some reviews mentioned that it is a construction zone, but thankfully, looks like that is done now.

"It's a flagship property of Sterling Holidays that has been completely rebuilt as a modern, well-appointed resort in Darjeeling. The resort has everything going for it except the road that connects it to the main street. This one km stretch is a nightmare on which even 2 bikes will find it hard to pass. All the excitement of reaching one's destination evaporates when one enters this narrow gully. The resort has good rooms, nice restaurant, bar, and other services. Friendly, helpful staff, with Mr. Uttam, the Chief Chef conjuring up very good and varied menus, presented nicely. The icing on the cake is the Kanchenjunga Viewpoint from where we were lucky to get a close view of this Himalayan beauty in all her gilded glory this morning.

In my 10 years and experience of 100+ vacations across the globe Sterling Darjeeling is the WORST of the lot. TripAdvisor does not allow negative rating but Sterling Darjeeling bagged ( -) NEGATIVE ratings.   To begin with: 1. Entry road under maintenance . So they made us ( with small kids) or elderly above 55 to carry their own luggage across steep slope of 20 metres.  No assistance from gatekeeper or the staff. I have never been UNWELCOMED in hospitality industry like this.  2. Darjeeling is popular for the Sunrise scene early morning. Only one WAITER was at the reception for all the excited ( fooled) guests. No provision for any unpaid or paid food facility or at least a Tea - Darjeeling is famous for !!!

I moved in to this hotel because of a bad experience from a luxury hotel in Darjeeling town. Got scared to see the road from Ghoom to this property. But the location and property was awesome. Even though this hotel is little far from Darjeeling town it is a nice family resort and cleanly maintained. My premium room was upgraded to a premium cottage. Many thanks for that. Big rooms next to kids play area. Good inhouse dining options. Little expensive. Sadly They just had tandoori roti and naans but no Chappatis. Very good breakfast spread with South Indian items.

Stroll in the resort park, just in no time, the area gets covered with fog but again get clears in a flash. Rooms are definitely good but cottages are worth staying. The only drawback is the narrow entrance from main highway to the resort road and the climb of the rod is quite stiff. People who will go on a self drive might find it difficult to drive in.

"This is the first hotel, where the staff is equally bad as the hotel. Horrible location, Bad food, unprofessional staff and atrociously overpriced. The following are the reasons why I would strongly recommend not staying in the hotel: 1. The Hotel  approach road is paved and very steep, still they generally do not have adequate number of cars for pick up and drop. Even while we were checking out they could not guarantee a vehicle, we finally had to arrange ourselves. Even when I wanted to go outside for emergency medication, they could not provide a vehicle and I had to wait. 2. No first aid trained personnel available. 3. No Fire Extinguisher, Safety Plan, Evacuation plan available. 4. Wrong room keys given twice. 5.

"The resort has been renovated and is very nice place for a family holiday. Away from the hustle and bustle of Darjeeling, yet close to Darjeeling. The Staff of the hotel is very helpful and accommodating. A special mention for Mr. Jayanta Bose the manager of the resort and Mr. Jayanta the executive chef of the resort. They looked after us really well and made sure we felt at home and comfortable. Thanks once again for this. Some suggestion though. That you should install a 100% drying machine in the resort to dry your laundry. Given Ghoom’s weather the towels don’t dry and pick up the stale smell. This will sort the problem out.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We were in Khush Alaya – a sterling property from 7/6 to 10/6/16. This is in Ghoom Area, which is around 8 k.m. from Darjeeling. Hotel is away from the city and it is on more height than Darjeeling. This is next to Ghoom Monestry which is the oldest monestry of Darjeeling Awesome feeling – like you are in the clouds – all the times. All natural no artificial.  The best part is having bar out of the restaurant  Staff was courteous. Service was very prompt and always ready to help and will go out of the way even to resolve the issue, if any.

All we expected from the resort manager, Jayanto Bose was corporation, but he turned out to be very rude non-corporating nd in turn blamed us that we are lying and we must have lost it somewhere else.

"I have visited Darjeeling in month of April with family including a 3 and half year old son. We were two families. The decision to choose this Hotel was due a membership that our co-travelers had with Sterling Holidays.

Location: •	The property is located in Ghoom, around 1.5 to 2Km from Ghoom railway station and is on the hill. Hence from certain points you get good valley views. •	The road leading up to the property is narrow, steep, to an extent that you may wonder “Really Can we Go Thru”.  •	This property is adjacent to Ghoom Monestry, which is the oldest monastery in Darjeeling. •	Ghoom is around 8-10 KM from Darjeeling…",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

On the very first day we arrived we went  to the restaurant for lunch and ordered chicken biriyani… what we received was a small soup bowl topped with broken rice(not biriyani/basmati rice) which looked like it was the left over rice from the previous day (Photo uploaded).. and as hungry as we were we were not able to eat anything. The staff was also not well trained and the waiter who attended to us did not know how to serve us our meal (because the bowl was topped with rice so much so that he could not even put a fork or spoon into it or it all would have fallen)They did not even have serving spoons.

Situated at a quiet place with great facilities available for the guests starting from provision of tourist guides and vehicles to the gym and play arena etc it makes you feel at ease. during my stay there there was a performance organized by a dancer and most of the people staying at that time were invited for the show.

"This hotel is situated near Ghum monastery and half an driving distance from Darjeeling, This property is under renovation and only a portion of the hotel has been completed. The rooms are pretty good with all amenities and also every room has mountain facing windows. But, since we visited in June, the rainy season was already started because of the fog, we were not lucky enough to see any mountain. The food was excellent and its pretty costly. They provided room heater without any extra charges and also breakfast was free. I must say, their service staff is excellent.

Its uphill and quite like a trek from the ghoom railway station (which was till some time back the highest railway station in the world) .

Rooms have a lovely view of the monastery or the adjoining tea gardens, The main entrance to the resorts shares it wall with a buddhist monastery.

"Following is my feedback and review of the sterling resort located in ghoom, darjeeling called as Silver Oaks, visited from 8 to 11 may 2014.  First of all let me tell you this resort is 8 km from main darjeeling market, it is located in Ghoom, with one of the beautiful monestary  located just adjacent to hotel. From the main gate to the hotel buiding the road is very steep so if you're young and energetic then do walk or the tour operators will take you directly in the car. best thing of the resort is you get View of Kanchenjunga (Highest peak in india).

I had travelled as a Guest in late March'14 with my family and found it very horrible. I am thankful to myself that I am not a member of Sterling Resort. Its not to be treated as a resort rather than we should treat this property as a lodge. Full of Crowd. It is situated  in Ghoom quite far away from Darjelling. The approach road to this property is so narrow that at one point of time you will feel that you are driving in a small village. For those who are visiting Darjelling must search some other good accommodation in Darjelling itself because local travel is very expensive. For going and coming to Local main MG Market of Darjelling  a Taxi will charge you INR 600/- from this place. Hence I do not recommend for this place.,Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

Food is very much overpriced. A tea will cost you 120 rupees including taxes.  As a large tourist group was present in hotel, lot of noise and the worst part was, we were served the left over food of that group.  No one is bothered to pay heed to any compliant.

Very good locality. Ghoom being at an higher altitude than Darjelling - this property has excellent views of the hilly range. You can see Mt. Kanchenjunga from this hotel. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The restaurant ambiance is good but the food taste is average and its expensive. They have a club house where you may enjoy playing Table tennis in the evenings (as there is no activity post sunset in darjelling). The resort also has a place for Bonfire.

Its really impossible to have any food from outside as there are no restaurants nearby. The Food is very expensive. Only this aspect makes the hotel not worthy.

"We had booked (in hindsight a BIG mistake) for a family holiday. First, the location of the resort(?) is 18 kms out of Darjeeling in Ghoom. It is a steep climb up if you decide to walk from the main road to the hotel. The entrance of the hotel is crowded with taxis and drivers.  The reception area was full with guests checking in/out. There was luggage lying all around. The cottage given to us was an old cottage lacking in modern amenities. It would have been good in olden days, but not now. The TV was old with limited channels (No DTH). There was no running hot water in the bathrooms. We had to ask housekeeping for hot water buckets.  The kitchen was dirty, the main door would not lock properly. The towels were torn and stained(looked like rust/blood marks).  The food was cold,…",Date of stay: May 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

"We visited darjeeling in the month of June with very expectation. As we were sterling club member, we choose to book SIlver Oaks Sterling Resort. However the stay was disappointing.  To start with, we were asked to call a day prior to confirm our visit. We keep on calling and were unable to reach them, There was a mobile number which kept on ringing with nobody on the other side receiving it. We reached the resort. It is basically a huge property near ghoom station (7 km from darjeeling, from where you can catch the toy train).   The resort is not that clean . We had a look at the rooms. The mats were dirty with smell around. We requested to change the room. The other room turned out to be similar. Finally we settled, though unhappy with the rooms.

"I stayed with my Wife and Kid in the 3rd week of June in a deluxe suite. The stay was terrible because of following reasons:  1. No hygiene is maintained in rooms, beds, bathrooms, balcony etc. We never felt we were living in a deluxe suite. Pretty ordinary rooms. 2. Old furnitures as if it is going to break. 3. The bedding was horrible. It was as if we were sleeping on a floor. We requested for a layer of bedding, however, it was conveyed that it will be chargeable. Not sure why. 4. The swings, see-saw etc in the Kids play area were rusted. It seems no maintenance was done since long time.  The only plus point about this property is the View of Kanchenjunga from this resort which is awesome.",Date of stay: June 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

We stayed in this hotel in the last week of May 2013... Good things about the Hotel - 1. Nice lobby and Restaurant 2. Great complimentary breakfast. It has lots of variety. 3. Good evening entertainment with DJ and tambola.  Bad things about the hotel - 1. Rooms and the towels were dirty. Staff was not ready to even change the hotel room. 2. Most of the staff was unfriendly. Showed rude behavior when asked to change the room as the bed sheets and the pillow was very dirty. It had stains and foot prints all over. 3. Food was very costly. One cup tea costs Rs.85/- 4. Very far from Darjeeling. 9KM which takes 30min by drive to get to mall road. 5. Very over priced hotel.

"Highly recommended if you are staying at Darjeeling. Look out for the cottages marked as ""Kanchenjunga View Point.""  Comfortable beds, clean rooms and good service. Avoid booking transport as it was more expensive from the hotel. Also it is advised to eat more at restaurants in D'jng. The buffet is a good spread but slightly expensive. The property is adjacent to the oldest monastry in theis part, the Ghoom monastry. Over all a good place to stay and relax.",Date of stay: January 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
This property of sterling is located in Ghoom about 7 Km from the mall road. Usually sterling property are located outskirts only.

"The Sterling resort is actually outside the town of Darjeeling in Ghum and is well located next to a peaceful monastery. Ghum is the railway station before Darjeeling and is well connected by road and rail. The rooms need renovation as the resort is a few decades old. Its a good place to stay away from the hustle and crowd of Darjeeling. The place is spacious and the staff are willing and eager to assist. The entrance is amazingly steep, but local vehicles manage it and there are always steps to walk up beside the driveway. The views are great and most of the rooms have a kitchenette, so you are not dependent on the restaurant alone.",Date of stay: April 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

From this property the Kanjanjunka view is seen, especially in the mornings. Rooms are good. Staff provide excellent service. Food served are very nice. If required we can cook inside the room. Small crockery shop is there inside this property. Neatness cant be expected in Ghoom & Darjeeling. Its advisable to stay in Ghoom than Darjeeling as later is congested. There are not much place to be seen. People who like to stay in a place to enjoy the climate can visit Darjeeling according to me.

However, GHOOM is at a higher altitude when compared to Darjeeling; thus it is colder too.  Nearby, you have the GHOOM station where you can enjoy the Toy Train rides.   The standard rooms are in a mess. Cracked walls, broken cabinets.  Go in for the Duplex Cottages. They have two bedrooms on the upper level. One room with an attached washroom.

It was a disappointment considering we had heard much about this resort through our client. The desk was undermanned, the room service was wanting and the staff seemed very laid back.   The rooms were average and the electricity kept going off which meant disturbance during the conference. This is possible due to the onset of the monsoons. The training room however was spacious.

The deluxe rooms looked good too, some of those will have views right from the bed(but not all).   The hospitality of everyone at the hotel was superb. We were welcomed by Dupden who checked us in and made us feel right at home from the get go. He catered to all our demands(special room request, change of rooms etc) with a smile on his face and exemplary service.  If you want great views this is the hotel to stay at. Hands down the best view in all of darjeeling(and thats including the one from tiger hill).

I visited Darjeeling from 26th to 29th of December with my family. For me it was not a first trip but for my family it was. We stayed at Summit Grace. We booked a suite room which was just on top of the hill. Mount Kanchenjunga was clearly visible from the common balcony. The rooms are well maintained. Food is delicious. Staffs of the hotel are very courteous. Would like to especially mention the name of their manager Mr. Kinchok who has a very helping attitude and Ms.Karuna who provides services to the guests in their restaurant. Her sweet smile and excellent hospitality should not be missed.  The mountain and valley view from the hotel is mesmerising.

Food was also excellent. The only problem for us was that the wet clothes did not dry enough during the night but this is the casse for all Darjeeling hotels probably.

"Stayed in the hotel for 1 night. I booked for  deluxe room, when I reached hotel they told me that I got a free upgrade to Suite Room as the deluxe rooms are all filled. The room was big, however being in a hill station it was laking basic things like a good room heater. The socalled room heater provided by hotel was not adequate for the whole room. There was not enough plug points in the room for plugging electric blanket or phone charger. It was an unpleasant stay in a cold night. The food was OK . The only thing I like in the hotel is the view of Kanchenjunga from the terrace ( The 2 starts are for that only). However, the same kind of view you can get from neighouring hotels also. I would not recommend this place during cold days.",Date of stay: January 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

"We stayed at this hotel for a couple of days in October of 2019. The hotel is located at the upper edge of Darjeeling, away from the hustle and bustle of the town centre. The view from the terrace is magnificent. Our room (109) was cold and damp. We found a small electrical heater in the room, which somewhat improved the temperature, but it could not chase the damp from the mattress, the blankets en the bedsheets. The bathroom was very small. It had no ventilation whatsoever. We did not shower, because that would have brought even more water vapour into the room. The restaurant staff were helpful and very friendly.

The room and bathroom were cramped and didn’t have enough space to keep our stuffs.

The TV was mounted on the wall and had a protruding set-top box which we kept hitting every time we passed through the narrow space between the bed and the TV.

The hospitality here was really poor and below average as you need to wait long post asking something and also on leaving they leave their ethics behind as we were not even given two water bottles for a long travel till Bagdogra when asked they provided already used water bottles by guests by refilling them it was reducible.  Coming in plus points the food was very good and tasted amazing so here am thankful to kitchen staff.

"Delux Room with the view of Khangchendzonga wasn't big enough for a family of two and a half (our 5-year-old) so we chose the one facing the road. The queen size bed was a little tight for us but there wasn't a lot of space in the room for an extra cot. Enough storage for a family traveling with a kid. We had a good bathroom and a room heater.   The terrace has an excellent view but the slippery tiles are risky. If you want to stay inside and enjoy the view, get the terrace view rooms.

The moment we entered the hotel it had positive vibes, good aroma and pleasant girls who welcomed us with so much affection!  I would like to specifically mention about Ms. Manjita Pradhan who goes out of the way to help the guests with anything and everything. It was good to see her around and whenever she was busy with work and not there we missed her lovely smile! You have a long way to go Manjita! Wish you all success in life...

Great experience to stay at this hotel. The suite rooms are excellent with great valley views. They are also providing bonfire inside room. Staffs are very good especially manjita.

I recommed this hotel if anyone looking to explore the magnificient views from room as well as ambiance.,Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We went to this hotel very recently. And I've got to say that it is a great stay. The rooms are spacious and have a very good view. They have small balconies in rooms and even a huge common terrace. The staff is extremely friendly and made out stay very comfortable. To anyone who thinks the price is a bit expensive. I'd have to say that the stay is worth every penny you spend there.,Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We checked in late in the evening the journey as bit tiring as the hotel is on top but it was all worth it once we reached, the check-in was smooth nd we had 3rooms and our rooms were upgraded free of charge. Prompt room service and even food is delicious 😋. Rooms were clean and well kept. We enjoyed borne fire in the night. And the best thing happened when hotel person called us up saying we left some of our stuff and we couldn't get back as we had our plans ahead which we couldn't hamper, so they sent it to us on our address with out any cost. I would recommend this hotel and definitely visit again.",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"The biggest drawback of the hotel is its location. It is situated quite uphill and far away from the market making general commute quite tedious. At the same time, this steep location means an excellent view of Kanchenjungha.  Regular rooms on the 1st floor are quite ordinary and mouldy. We upgraded to the top floor suite rooms on additional payment and it was worth it. Food is good and the staff, particularly its manager, Mr Kashyap, quite helpful",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
My boyfriend and I stayed 5 nights last month. The Staff here are very well trained hospitality professionals and they have made us feel like this place is our home in Darjeeling. Especially Sumit was our very charming waiter and he provided us spectacular services every meal and I am sure he will surely take great care of you as well. There were couple of times our room got blacked out but they were efficient about resolving our problems.  Problems can happen anywhere but the way the staff handle the problems show whether its a good hotel or not.

"I got upgraded to Suite Room from Deluxe Room by paying a few bucks extra, but was worth in the end... as i got an excellent kanchenjunga view from the suite’s balcony (tiger hill view bhi fail hai 😉). Room service was prompt and cleanliness was also upto the mark. The hotel overall was a very very good place to stay but you need to walk a lot or get a cab to reach main market area to buy anything. Summit Hermon is also a good option if you need to stay close to market area.",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

From the greeting upon our arrival until the moment we left, we were warmly treated as special guests with the utmost attention to detail. It appears that the service culture at Summit is never to say no to anything. Our every whim was catered to and we never felt like we were imposing on the staff. They seemed eager to please their guests and were visibly excited to assist in any way that they could. They knew us by name and noticed.

The view is excellent and gives an amazing overview of the the town overlooked by the mighty Kanchendzonga.

Its away from the noise but close enough  Taxi is available for rs 150 to mall road ,which takes 5 mins.  The hotel is a budget hotel ..2k per night and has all basics sorted. We spent 4 nights.  November is cold but the heated blankets will sort it out. Would have preferred more sound insulation in our room as we could hear noises from the adjacent room. In house restaurant is good enough for all meals.  Better to order and go there when the food is ready as few nights we had to wait about 30 to 45 mins for basic Dal and sabzi. And they never have gulab jamun . Should probably take it off the menu.",Date of stay: November 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"We visited Darjeeling in the best season- May 2017 and Summit Grace hotel did not disappoint us at all.   The food spread is a very good value for money with veg and non veg buffet options available for lunch and dinner.  The rooms are extremely cozy, cut out from the noise and hustle bustle of the Darjeeling market and when we visited were extremely well kept.  The Darjeeling view across the common terrace is good and gets better and better as the evening commences.   The only thing that we disliked about the hotel is the location- it is along a steep slope, way away from the mainland and there are shanties nearby.   But overall a very good stay!",Date of stay: May 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The duplex room we got on the 2nd day was awesome. If possible book that. Its got a premium feel to it also the view from this is amazing.  I have stayed in 3 different summit properties must say the experience at all 3 was superb.  Though there were some problems regarding the room i had booked, the way they handled the situation says a lot about how much they value customer service.

The room heaters did not work well. We stayed for quite few hours and then reported to the manager. The manager was ready to allot a different better room to us. It could have been done when we came but not sure what went wrong. Anyways, the room was bit cleaner but lots of things to improve. Positives-  Very nice view from the hotel rooms and lobby.

"After a slightly negative experience at a Summit property in Gangtok, I was a little apprehensive about what I could expect at Darjeeling. And it didn't quite start that well when the slightly uppity manager greeted me while talking to someone on the phone. He then snootily told me to take care of my phone and camera, as ""customers tended to forget these things"", which hurt even more since at the Gangtok Summit, our earphones had indeed been ""lost"" (more about that in a separate review). The rest of the staff and the room itself though more than made up for the snob's behaviour (luckily we didn't have to deal with the guy again). The room was great, the food was the best we had in our entire holiday, and the rest of the service staff polite and eager to oblige, though we did…",Date of stay: June 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

This is a 3 star hotel but has all facilities of 4 star. Staff is well trained and educated compared to the other hotels found in hill stations. Food is good- nothing exceptional but yes you would wish to try everything in their breakfast buffet. They serve dessert in morning as well :) Location is pretty much bad- you will have to take a cab from market located down the hill. It is on a steep hill and is cab-only for people not used to climbing/fitness routine. It serves you a beautiful view of Kanchenjunga.

Hotel room is quite small for standard deluxe but its good that flooring were provided with wooden. Amenities were good and service was not bad. but it is difficult to reach from the main bazaar as it is quite far. Around 2 km away from toy train. Only with car we can reach that hotel. They provided TV with Hathway dish tv which is not at all working well always with interruption. We can view the mount kanchenjunga from that hotel itself instead of going to tiger hill.

PROS: I guess this hotel is situated at the topmost position among other hotels in Darjeeling which is the USP of this place...you get the mesmerizing view of Mt. Kanchenjunga from balcony. Enjoyed with morning tea. Food is very good here and i liked the hospitality of hotel staff .  CONS: Only place where they need to improvise a bit is bathrooms. They need a bit renovation. You have to take cab for going to market as the hotel is situated a bit far from market but that should not be much of a problem as cabs are readily available.   Verdict: Overall it a nice and comfortable place to stay.  I strongly recommend this one for couples and family. Go for good food and awesome view from hotel.

The location is away from the main Darjeeling centre, which could be great if you are looking for a quiet stay away from the crowded mall / bazar area. It is a 30 min walk downhill to the mall, but while coming back to the hotel, a taxi is a must which would cost something like INR 150 from clubside and INR 400 from the bus stand.

The hotel is situated top of the hill. The area is clam and quit. Apart from the view of Kanchanjangha and room interior design , I did find nothing. FOOD and Service is not good. We had buffet breakfast in which the food service was not so fast. So if you plan for a day trip , you have to wait so long to have your break fast.

The beds were slightly small for a tall person. And there were glitches initially in the maintenance like geyser or flush not working but they were fixed immediately.

I will not recommend this place of stay to anyone. Given the prices that one pays we at least expect basic hygiene. The bathroom was stinking so much. And they didn't really do anything much about it. When we arrived we were given a room which was closed for I don't know how many days. It was very stuffy. We got the room changed to a valley facing room which was a bit better light and air wise. But the bathroom situation was the same. Thankfully the TV's work. Apart from this the lunch / breakfast / dinner - Food was just passable. Its more than a km from the marked. and the walking way is too steep which leaves you taking 200 rs taxi to the market for lunch /window shopping or any other leisure activity.

Rooms and toilet are small but cosy with all the amenities with 24 Hr running hot and cold water.I stayed in Room # 105 adjacent to a fantastic open terrace with wonderful view and we enjoyed our drink sitting there. Food is good and tasty. Every staff member is ever smiling and at your service to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. I was going out to Mall and it was drizling so the security gaurd even provided us umbrella. I really enjoyed staying and will come back again.,Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

What's good  The staff is highly courteous. Rooms are small but cozy and warm. Breakfast buffet was amazing.  Whats not good  Location is little far and high but that gives a good view and a misty charm to the place.  What to do  Nothing. Just relax. Take a bottle of wine and enjoy the hospitality.,Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Interiors of the hotel are great with antique wood work. Upon arrival we received warm welcome. Rooms were spacious and with great views. Staff was very courteous & helpful. Restaurant was also good with delicious B'fast and dinner.  Although with just one staff service was very slow.  Upon Checkout we felt we were being cheated as we were blamed of a broken water tap in bathroom which caused water leak. Unfortunately when we left the room it was in perfect condition although it was leaking every time we used the bathroom so we didn't took it seriously and didn't complained. But upon Checkout the guard went up to the room to check the room and said that we had broken the tap.  We felt very embarrassed.,Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
The look of the hotel from outside was disappointing but the interiors were so good. The entire stay at Summit Grace was awesome. The rooms were clean and food was delicious . It was flawless!

"We went to Darjeeling in the mid of May. Apart from comfortable weather, our hotel room was very cozy. We had got a deluxe room which I felt was small for movement but had a cozy feel to it. I would really like to mention the very courteous staff which was very helpful and always smiling. The only bad score was food which through out our stay was average or rather below average sometimes (indian preparations - food was fresh but not good in taste). Overall, it was a nice experience and would recommend the hotel for its scenic beauty (balcony view) and the very courteous staff. Cons: small rooms and not so tasty food.

I visited the hotel along with family - 2 rooms - 4 adults and 4 kids. Rooms are just way too small for a comfortable stay with family. Bathrooms are also way too small for family's comfort.

We stayed one night in Summit Grace. The hotel doesn't have a frontal view. They show photo of their balcony on the booking sites. The rooms are too small for a couple and extra bed. The lobby is very congested. The common balcony is good. You get a good view of the valley from the room. Quite far and at a height from the mall road.

This property is on a hill that you almost feel like you are on top of Darjeeling. But that makes it impossible to walk to reach the hotel from the market area.   The interiors are completely made out of wood which makes you feel that you have entered an antique building. But the rooms are compact and so is the hotel that it sometimes makes you feel claustrophobic. The hotel has got a big balcony from where one can get a good view of the Darjeeling town. The food is pretty good and the breakfast has got good options to chose from.,Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"When we arrived at Summit Grace at afternoon we were a little confused because it didn't look like the one we saw in pictures when I booked. But once you are inside, you'd be pleasantly surprised. I doesn't look like a big hotel from outside but it is. Reception staffs were warm and welcoming. Rooms were big and spacious. We were staying in a group of 3 and unlike most hotels they don't provide with extra mattress for the 3rd person. Instead they have a whole freaking attached room with bed and TV. We had a great time watching the India's Asia cup game. Breakfast was included and it was pretty good. Only drawback is the location. Every time you have to pay 300 bucks to go come and go.

On the downside, being on the top most floor it was chilling cold with no appropriate heating options. They did provide wood for bonfire, which was a good touch to the hospitality. Food was average,compared to other properties of Summit. Quiet far from the market place. Need to take taxi for commuting to/fro Mall road.

Pros:   Fantastic view of Mt Kanchenjunga from some of the rooms as well as the open terrace and, an excellent staff.  Each member of the staff is accommodating and eager to help.

The balcony has a bench in between every room, so you could relax with a book in hand and some hot coffee, with the mountains and greenery giving you company.  2)  Room service is very prompt and Ms Pema makes it a point to personally call you once the breakfast buffet is laid. Also, the restaurant was managed by Ms Pema, who is an asset to the hotel, in my view. Her behavior, her prompt service and her polite nature would make you smile and feel special. 3) Food is good.

Pathetic cable TV, not a  single worthwhile channel to see and you get really bored in the evenings. They even tried to charge me extra for using a heater, which luckily got sorted out due to the prompt intervention of Deepshikha their customer relations manager which I appreciate.   This place is far away from the main market area and the taxi charges Rs 200/- each way.

We stayed 2 nights. When we checked in the hotel they kindly upgraded us to a suite although we had booked a delux room. The suites are certainly better but nothing special. The bedroom is on a mezzanine floor while there is very little on the lower level other than a bathroom and a small sitting area. The good things are the special effort they put in to make sure the guests are happy but this is quickly outweighed by the bad things Firstly no heating in room and this place is freezing in November. We asked for some heating and they supplied a small electric heater that was completely inadequate. The meals are OK but the dining room staff have limited english and it all is a bit hit and miss. The hotel is a long way up a steep hill and far too far to walk into the central area.…,Date of stay: November 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

"Although I visited this hotelsome time back !I have finally found time to review this hotel. After a harrowing terrible experience at their sister hotel , I decided to be transferred to Summit Grace as it had fairly good reviews . However this hotel turned out to be as disgraceful ! The room they gave me was damp , dingy , cold and cramped. The hotel staff were not helpful either in sorting my problems out always claiming the hotel was full ! However i hardly saw any guests here ! The location of the hotel is also bad . It takes a good 25 minutes from the town of Darjeeling to get here by car . I was very unhappy !

"There is a saying ""You can get a lot of things done with a kind word and a gun"". In this case though, my reviews have been largely neutral/positive because of the excellent customer service that we received at this place. The hotel manager Mr. Karma was very nice to us.  Good: When we saw the facility and the rooms, to be frank, we were a bit let down (after been in other Summit owned resorts). This is more a ""heritage"" hotel and less of a resort. I mentioned about this in passing to my travel agent. Within the next 2 hours, the hotel manager Mr. Karma met me in person and upgraded us to their biggest attic suite.

True to its name, Summit Grace stands tall at the peak of the mountain overlooking the magnificent Darjeeling town; giving us a view of the splendid view of the Kanchenjunga at one side, the Japanese peace temple at the other and The Pauls School hidden within the dense pine trees behind us.   Though a thick blanket of fog covered the Kanchenjunga most of the times; we were fortunate to get a glimpse of its peak from our balcony at sunrise. We guess summers would be an apt time to have a better look at the it from the balcony.   Being our honeymoon, we…",Date of stay: February 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Darjeeling was most beautiful and lifetime experience for us.We are so glad that we selected Darjeeling as our honeymoon destination and equally glad that we decided to stay in Summit Grace.Location of the hotel is superb ,its located at very high altitude which gives clear view of the  town.Chalet rooms are very well designed to give a look of Villa.With Kanchenjunga on one side and Japanese temple on the other side, this hotel is totally picturesque.Room service is good  and food is very yummy.The only part they need to improve is geysers in the bathroom which are quite small and not suitable for the cold weather there.Also the complementary breakfast should have better options.No doubt, Darjeeling and Summit both calls for second visit!",Date of stay: February 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Traveled in February 2015 with siblings. Gem of a hotel tucked away in the mountains of Darjeeling with excellent service and pleasant faces all around. Special mention to their restaurant staff, who constantly kept our glasses filled with warm water and supplied some scrumptious meals over our 2 day stay. My only complaint, the bathroom interiors and facilities were less than desirable and for that I'll knock off a point. Look forward to visiting again some day.",Date of stay: February 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Summit Grace is located just in front of the Primary wing of St. Paul's School, the place where I gave my early 5 years of schooling. Was excited to stay in the rooms as i could see my school on one side and also the snow caped mountains on the other side.   The hotel staff made prominent arrangements for our car parking and also for our drivers. we were given a room up gradation to a chalet room from a deluxe room which my fiancee loved it. Newcomers to darjeeling will find the hotel quite away from the city center or The Mall but I did not find so, as i knew all the shortcuts to the town which I used 16 years back while studying in St. Paul's .

Considering I was traveling with a 6 yo and a 11 m infant I wanted a very comfortable place for a stay and Summit Grace was at par with my expectations. The hotel is quite away from the city center or The Mall as it is called and hence it is a necessity for a taxi to be arranged daily for to and fro (as well as sight seeing since Darjeeling attractions are scattered across). Once you enter the hotel you are greeted in the traditional style and a welcome drink is provided. The hotel staff is excellent in all areas. All of them always greet you with a smile and are always warm in their hospitality. I had issues with an extra bed since this was not informed by my travel agent to the hotel.

First and foremost let me thank all the staff at Summit Grace for making my honeymoon days so special that everyday that we stayed there was just awesome. Starting from the reception staff who helped me to get around the place like Ashis and Stanley and everyone who arranged the surprise cake and wine at our beautifully set room. The colonial setting of the hotel just added up the beauty of the entire experience. I am so glad that I chose your hotel and planned my entire trip around it.

You have to remain defendant on hotel service which is  a bit pinching to the pockets.  Further you have to depend/pay Rs. 150 for going down to mall road.  Rooms are good ( though our room's wooden flooring was damaged one)..  Views from the hotel is nice provided there are no clouds.

As we were tired and in no mood to argue (e.g. that the fair deal would be to reimburse us the price difference between the two rooms and to offer the dinner as additional excuse for ruining the first day of our holidays) we agreed.

"Darjeeling, even though situated in the state of West Bengal, enjoys a partial autonomous status. Located near foothills of Himalayas, it's at an elevation of roughly around 7000 ft above sea level and has a subtropical highland climate. Weather hovers around 6 Deg C in the night to 17 Deg C in day time in summers so a most sought after hill station to escape from summer heat. And it boasts of Himalayan Railway, narrower than narrow gauge....one of the few UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India. It is about 3 hours drive from Bagdogra, the nearest airport. Transport in a Innova costs 3,500 INR one way.

"I booked Summit Grace and Spa just for 1 night through the internet, as I had to stay in Darjeeling for 2 nights (and I had another hotel booked for myself for another night) and the hotel of my choice was not available for my first day of stay in Darjeeling. I checked into this hotel in the late evening and when I entered into the hotel I could not believe my eyes. it was a SHOCKING experience. The hotel was so small and it seemed so claustrophobic. It was like I have entered into some bylanes of a city. The decor was so bad and done is a very bad taste.

It has an awesome balcony, which offers splendid views of the Town below as well.   The Hotel is clean, and has very friendly staff who always had a smiling countenance.   The inconveniences were too many to count, though  1. The location is quite a hassle, as it is up a steep incline where even cars like the Indica will find difficult to go up, reverse and come back down. But then, of course, this is a hill-station and not a metro city we are talking about. So, it is okay.  2. The rooms are extremely small and cramped. At least ours was.

Located at the coolest place of Darjeeling (jalpahar), the rooms are too cold for your liking round the day.

"Transferred from Summit Norling , Gangtok to this place. Although this place is just a year old, but the upkeep is not so good. We had booked a Suite & deluxe. Rooms are small  & badly lit.  Lots of ups & downs ( steps)in all rooms. The Suite is decent with an extra bed & small area below whereas the bedroom is a level above. The head-room in that level is small. Bathrooms are small & slippery with poor drainage in deluxe rooms. They have a really  small dining area on the 1st level. Hence it often gets overcrowded when the hotel is full. The Buffet spread is sumptuous with a good variety & taste. The room service is poor &  it really checks your patience at times.    To sum it up ,it's a really new & a small place with good view & food but poor upkeep & room service. A real…",Date of stay: March 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Friends, Beware of going to this hotel. We had opted for suite rooms but this is the worst ever suite I have seen. Lights not working properly, Bathroom lights out of order, bathroom lock doesnt work, by the time you bathe, there is a pool of water around you, wash basin drainage leaking. The staff at the reception and the manager does not listen to or care to rectify the problems, Only thing appreciable is the restaurant staff.",Date of stay: March 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

"It's pretty high up above Darjeeling and a bit of a hike to get to the town, but if you are in adequate physical shape that's not much of a problem, although the streets are winding and you might want to keep track of your route. You can always get a taxi if need be. Darjeeling can be pretty cold temperature-wise, so dress warmly. Unfortunately the hotel only had a little space heater so that was on the whole time we were in. They seem to have a limited supply of hot water too, so keep your showers short. The view however is spectacular. You can see way down the mountain and the Himalayas in the distance. The restaurant was pretty good and they will make you an omlet for breakfast if you like. It's pretty quiet up there and you feel a bit like you are in a chalet. Don't expect…",Date of stay: February 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Very nice hotel and especially whole staff was very cooperative and understanding for family esp with kids. Booked top floor suite and it turned out to be a great decision considering had to be indoors for whole day due to political bandh in Darjeeling. Food service was also quick and effective and made our stay very comfortable. Wishing them all the best and will visit soon again....,Date of stay: February 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
I am happy with the service and cooperation of the hotel.As I admit my son to St.pauls I will be frequently visit this hotel.my only advice is they should have more service people who understand English.

"This is probably the best place to stay in Darjeeling, if you are looking for the best breath taking view of the Queen of Hills - Darjeeling. The Kanchangunja with its majestic view, the entire Darjeeling town right in front of you like a painting and a panoramic view of the Sangrila. Of course, you need a clear day :)    Not to forget, the staff is very accommodating and warm!",Date of stay: February 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Great Hospitality! Food was awesome & every bit of it was taken care of very nicely & perfectionately.Love to be at this place again & again. Rooms were clean & tidy. Nice to see a chimney in the room. Staff was tidy & professional. A Bit disappointed with the food selection (Menu). But otherwise all in all a very good choice. Most importantly as this resort is new you will enjoy the hospitality,Date of stay: December 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"The one point which strikes as u reach the hotel after a long , tired, ever winding drive is the location. Whether u step into you room ot directly into its terrace which oversees the whole of darjeeing and the might kanchanjunga or "" kanchanjoonga"" as the locals prfer calling it , u cannot beat the view.   The hotel seemed to have been added on top of a residential building as understand the stange architecture of the rooms and the areas inside. Our room wwas really small and must be the smallest as the bed was amlost touching both the sides. There seemed to be a lot of leakages around the structure as the entire passage paint seemd to be coming off on our clothes as we walk past .

"i booked a deluxe room for my honeymoon from 21st Dec 2012 to 26th Dec 2012.  Promptness: there was only a small glitch when i checked-in to the room, as the floor mat was a little dirty and the floor was not very clean.  as soon as i gave the feedback, one person from housekeeping, Sujay, immediately requested me to take a seat and offered us masala chai. by the time the chai was done, they cleaned up my room and i was ready to go.  Location: this resort is located on one of the highest points in Darjeeling. like us, if you like long walks to the market and don't mind going up the slopes, this is the best place to be; even if you don't the taxi will drop you to this location from the market. you can also continue further up the slope for a nice walk through the thickets and see…",Date of stay: December 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Plus points of this 'Resort' :- 1. Location is good. Good view of Mt kanchenjunga. 2. Cozy clean beds. 3. Breakfast spread was good.  Negative points: 1. Management needs to be overhauled and bring more professionalism. 2. Its not a resort but seems to be converted from a house. No lawns, etc. The gate starts from the roadside! 3. Small rooms, very average furnishing, no eye for details 4. Toilets smell of urine, no warm water, room very cold. 5. Bad room service;eg took abt 45 mins to make 2 cups of tea.  Not Worth a stay. Avoid !!",Date of stay: December 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

"Literally one of the highest altitude hotels in Darjeeling, the ride up was a little unnerving althoug the hotel seemed to be really like the cosy den of an English mansion. The deluxe rooms were just about average (small spaces as in the case with most of the places there). The rooms had not been cleaned properly before we were moved in and although we reached at 6 in the evening they gave us the rooms in an hour's time. Housekeeping was not upto the mark. The staff and management apologized and upgraded us to one of the most beautiful chalet looking suites the next day. The rooms were duplex with a fireplace and a gorgeous and I MEAN GORGEOUS VIEW!!! The housekeeping staff did a great job the next day. The service is good and the restaurant is decent. I would recommend this…",Date of stay: November 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"It is quite new hotel and located in higher Darjeeling, ~1 km from the Mall. We stayed in the Suite and the room is nice and cozy, with wooden flooring and internally has two floors, like a small villa. Staff is very courteous and helpful. My little daughter enjoyed the room a lot ! The restaurant is yet to have full menu but I was informed that they will have everything soon. Kanchenjunga can be seen clearly right from outside the room and also from the restaurant. Overall very good place to stay, but only take Suite.",Date of stay: November 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"We stayed in this hotel because we could not find rooms in mayfair. We were a large group and had booked 6 suites. This was a hidden gem of a hotel. The suites were spacious with stunning views of the mountains. Very comfortable beds. Extremely super and helpful staff. Only thing was that the stairs in the suites were slippery. Breakfast spread was good. There were 2 stores just outside the hotel which sold chips, cold drinks etc so it was very convinient. Overall a very pleasant stay.",Date of stay: October 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"We stayed in the King Suite and were not disappointed. Our suite was comfortable and large and found the staff to be quite accommodating by suggesting and delivering a space heater. Although it's not exactly in the center, we had a stunning view from our room. We found the buffet breakfast to be satisfactory as well. The hot water situation is pretty dire in Darjeeling, but we had enough. Overall, great stay.",Date of stay: November 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Its right on top and near to St pauls school. It has excellent view of the snow covered kunchenchunga in the morning. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. The staff is very friendly and offered excellent services. Although the hotel is a little far from the market and the taxi would cost you approx Rs 100 but its worth the view and location you get in return. We liked the food too although it was a little more expensive. So if you are looking for a quiet place close to nature and away from the crowd and market this is an excellent option.,Date of stay: October 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"We were a group of 4 and went bang in the middle of monsoon season and originally were supposed to go to their gangtok property. however due to a landslid on the Bagdogra-Gangtok road we luckily were able to change our itinery on the spot n went to Darjeeling instead. After a 6 hour long trip we were greeted with a buddhist shawl which was a lovely touch and taken to our suites which were massive. The suites were duplex with a king size bed on top and a small bed in the bottom. Bathrooms were clean and the TV had most of the English channels.   But its USP is its location. Far from the center of the city filled with the hotels and noise, it is quiet and the view in the morning is to die for which is what you want on a holiday.

"I stayed there from 6th July to 10th July 2012. The staff members are really nice, they even helped me book a cab from new jalpaiguri to the Hotel. I had visited with my wife and we had booked a suite. I felt they are a bit overpriced for the location and for the space in the room. The bedroom had a sloping rooftop, very close to bed. The slope hit my head twice, which hurt really bad. We didn't get any table in room so we had to eat our dinner with plate in hand. The bathroom was leaking all over the place which I had complained about earlier but no action was taken. The food was good though all was not available which was mentioned on the menu.

"The location provides a quiet and peaceful time, but is a hassle to get to and from. The room doors are ""rustic"" and not sound proof, so if going during peak season, there won't be much peace and quiet. Our entire room was damp. Everything, bed, walls, ceiling dripped. Understandably it would be difficult to keep things dry during monsoon, but no effort was made by the cleaners or staff to keep the room from dripping or the black mould from taking over. For these prices a dehumidifier or the smelly balls could have been provided, at least. At most the walls could have been cleaned. The bathroom was less a shower and more a mould colony. The back of the door was fluffy with mould.

It is a new hotel and according to the management, they have started its operation since March, 2012. I have mixed reviews for this hotel. The first thing with this hotel is its location. Its located on a distant place from the mall road where no one knew the name of the hotel. I have book for a delux room. While entering in the hotel they told us to give suit rooms situated at the rooftop because they gave our rooms to other family because we checked in late and heavy rain was there and way to the suit rooms was not that good.

"We had planned a full trip to Darjeeling + Sikkim. Darjeeling was first in our itenarary and I had booked Summit Grace through ""Make my Trip"" at least 3 weeks before arriving there on 15th May with my family. We had booked a Suite at premium prices. We were about an hour away from Darjeeling when we got a call from this hotel saying that there is a technical problem and hence the hotel will be shifting us to another hotel. We were compeltely taken aback. Still we proceeded to the hotel and had a long argument. But there was no power and water at the hotel. We had no choice but to move to another hotel. Though the hotel was of similar standard but we were given only a standard room against the Suite room we had booked at Summit.
