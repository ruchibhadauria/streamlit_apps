"Oberoi Cecil - an absolutely stunning, welcoming, cozy place with the most warm and friendly staff always going out of their way to make you feel special.   My family and I are foodies and Chef Raj Kumar Bhatia is the DEFINITION OF CULINARY SKILLS! I wonder why he hasn‚Äôt participated in MasterChef; he would win hands down! Apart from trying out some of our favourite items on the menu, we were craving some of our very special Sindhi dishes. We happened to mention it to him and the very next day we were presented with a feast! He nailed every item to the T! Attached are just a couple of photos I happened to click for my Instagram stories but trust me those aren‚Äôt even the tip of the iceberg. It‚Äôs not even 1/10th of what we ate.

Since i have already given 5/5 rating, i really don't have any complaints or issues, but would point out what I felt at certain things:  1) I was asked to pay advance for incidentals. This practice is probably the most irksome practice a 5 star hotel could follow. Just cant understand the logic, especially when hotel tariff is 100% paid for in advance. Oberoi, ITC and Taj are definitely not in that league to ask for advance against perceived incidentals.  2) Contrary to Tripadvisor reviews, i believe food pricing is apt.

"Our stay at the Oberoi was undoubtedly the best accommodation experience that we had found over 18 days and ten hotels throughout India. From the initial check in procedure completed in the comfort of the lounge over hot chocolate, through the courtesy and service from our room maid to the service and quality in the restaurant it was first class. The hotel is well located and we walked to both the Viceroys Lodge and up to The Mall from it. On our first afternoon we did struggle up the hill with breathlessness, but soon became acclimatised to the rare air. One slight cloud on the horizon was that both of us suffered with upset stomachs having gone for European fish dishes as a break from Indian cuisine, and suffered for it!!

"Stayed for two nights in this beautifully refurbished hotel. It has a central atrium with balcony access to rooms running all the all around. Restaurant has view through trees to valley if you are sitting in seats near the windows but otherwise views hard to find. Staff are attentive and very well trained looking after guests beautifully. As this is a heritage building they have been limited to changing anything so there is no bar with a view, or rooftop view (roof is mainly glass) which considering its view is a shame. Many rooms however have great views which compensates somewhat. A really beautiful hotel, 10-15 mins walk uphill to the centre of the town.",Date of stay: March 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Service standards are impeccable from the moment you check in until the time you jump into your car after checkout....its paperless too.  Bedrooms have a wonderful view and are perfectly comfortable.  Food quality is of a high standard...it takes a Chef to be full of confidence in order to introduce himself in the dining room...this one does and he deserves the compliments he receives.  The lounge and bar are spectacular and have a quiet buzz as guests meet up and chat about their days exploring.

Hi Everyone and Hi Team Oberoi's Cecil... This must have been my atleast 5th or 6th stay in this property and by far the best.

The Cecil Oberoi was built in 1903 and extensively renovated in recent years but without changing its very Edwardian character. Much teal surrounds the majestic stairways whilst the rooms are all beautifully furnished. The rooms provided beautiful views across the hills and valleys of Shimla.

Room service is swift and our laundry was dealt with efficiently and returned immaculate.  The restaurant is a truly memorable experience, professional and smooth service so that attention is given to every request and food presentation is immaculate.

This hill-station town, once the official summer capital when Calcutta got too hot..was once a Victorian Disney World..now overpopulated by well-off Indians coming from Delhi and elsewhere..and their cars..no longer picturesque at all. Yes, there are hills all around..not mountains..and way off... a few snow-covered peaks.

"We exited the Toy Train at Shimla Station and were taken by taxi to the Oberoi Cecil Hotel, Shimla. What a stunning hotel in a stunning location. From there, we could see the foothills of the Himalayas and enjoyed panoramic views down the valley. We had a fabulous room and were greeted by Amardeep Singh, the General Manager. Immaculately dressed, he has been in post since 1989 and his team cannot do enough for the guests. He is a keen golfer and since I am President of Scottish Golf, we got on exceptionally well!  Needless to say, the food was superb. For one meal, I had anarkal murgh shorba, like spicy mulligatawny, followed by murgh dhauladhari -  chicken with crushed pomegranate seeds and fennel powder.

"Over the last few years, I have come to realize that there is no such thing as 'above average or satisfactory' on the Likert scale when it comes to the Oberoi hotels. Once spoilt, your baseline becomes a notch higher than what most of the competition is capable of. Some experiences exceed your expectations, like The Oberoi Mumbai, while some truly live up to them, like The Oberoi Cecil.   Located midway between a full blown Himalayan escape at the slightly more expensive Wildflower Hall (officially an  Oberoi property) and 'in the thick of The Mall' Clarke's (unofficially an Oberoi property ), The Cecil gives you the best of both worlds.

However, we were given rooms in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù section of the building ‚Äî it was wonderful.  Our room was large with a nice overlook of the valley, and was a little more quiet than the atrium.

Elegant and tasteful, with wood panelling everywhere, sumptious yet refined, it was a positive joy to rest here while we finished our tour of Northern India. Our first day we were very tired so remained in the hotel - we can't think of a better place on earth to recharge your batteries in elegant surroundings, topped off by a swim in the magnificent pool, our day was completed with a truly excellent meal.

The room itself was super, so big and spacious and everything in it you could need.  The lady who looked after my room was fantastic. On the first evening I could not find a plug near the bed to charge my phone but when the room was cleaned a drawer beside the bed was left open to show me the plug socket in it to use. I left a book on the bedside table and she placed a bookmark on it. It's the little things that make a big difference.

This is a five-star hotel and does not disappoint. We had a suite and it was huge. The daily Weather Guide was a great little extra service that makes places like this stand out. However, the food is truly exceptional. I'd stay here again even if the hotel wasn't as nice, just to get at that buffet again! Nothing is too much trouble for the chefs and I ate my bodyweight in curries and northern Indian cuisine. We also enjoyed trips into the Himalayan foothills - needed to burn those calories off!

If you are somewhere & just having a thought that if there was a hot cup of coffee, it would be even more amazing...next thing you'll see a coffee coming for you..without you even asking for it.

Beautiful heritage hotel near the middle of town. We had gorgeous valley view rooms which were very well appointed and included a bath as well as shower. The restaurant was very good (top on trip advisor) but very pricey by Indian standards.

With memories from yesteryear trip to Udaivilas Udaipur we booked again this welcoming property at Shimla and it turned out be the best choice amongst the rest.

The hotel has a pick up drop facilty with courteous drivers at a nominal price to the lift and it's the best option to choose from sparing one from hassles of parking.

Executive Chef Sanjay and Chef Rajkumar from the Oberoi Hotel Shimla wowed me with his expertise in Indian cooking flavors.  His talent is being able to merge the clear thai flavors with Indian cooking techniques, and some curry flavors. He mixes Thai chiles and masala spices to create his sauces.   Maybe this is southern Indian cuisine, which I‚Äôve only tasted  a few ties, but his flavors are definitely unique.  After four days of eating traditional Indian and Mughal cuisine, it was great to taste his food.

Vineet, Jatin and Kashish made our food breaks even more interesting with their friendly behaviour and humour along with the amazing dishes made by Chef Raj Kumar and Chef Amarjeet having an authentic taste and a stunning presentation.

"The hotel is in a great location for shopping and sightseeing e.g.  the Mall.  Our room had stunning views of the Himalayas from the balcony, which was a wonderful view to see when we woke up.  The hotel lives up to everything you would expect from a luxury hotel.  Beautiful interiors and ambience.  The staff were incredibly courteous and helpful at all times with special touches such as the complimentary snacks with drinks.  The restaurant served the best food we ate in all our travels in India including breakfast.  Special thanks to Ravi for his great service and recommendations.

"A beautiful old-style hotel. The lounge is simply stunning, and we had a drink there with live piano music, great atmosphere. The food was great, delicious. The swimming pool was delightful, heated and quite big, I also used a sauna that was relaxing and great.  The interiors are wooden that is charming especially nowadays, and very grand.  All the public areas are 5star (or more), however the room we stayed in was 4star I would say. The twin beds were very narrow with a wobbly mattress, and there was just fixed shower head in the bathroom, no hand shower. Still the room was comfortable. The staff were very very polite but I would say more distanced than friendly - maybe it's required in 5 star hotel but feels cold (still a few staff members were genuinely friendly and helpful).‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Quite simply the best service we have received in a major brand hotel. Oberoi are famous for luxury hotel stays and The Cecil delivers this but the point of this review is to highlight the quality of the staff at this hotel. The Chef, the Waiters, Housekeeping and Front of House Staff go out of their way to ensure your stay is simply wonderful. From the minute Alka showed us to our beautiful room she became ‚Äúour best friend in Shimla‚Äù offering advice on where to go and what to eat, ensuring that our stay was perfect and even making arrangements for our onward travels.

"Stayed here for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. The interior looked good, we had a very comfortable room in the main block and the staff were excellent. Friendly, and well trained. The dining room and food from the a la carte menu was ideal for us (vegetarian) with a good range of Indian and Continental dishes. Some organised parties seemed to have the buffet included in their package but we found the a la carte dishes were just right for our needs. The cost was not overly expensive but the practise of adding 2 lots of 9% tax in good hotels bumps the price up a bit.  The location is reasonably central to the 'town' and whilst there was a heavy snowfall while we there, it didn't seem to stop the train and the roads in and out of the 'town' are reasonably flat for it‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"After being on the road visiting the Golden Triangle and Varanasi, my husband and I were in need of a rest before flying back to the UK.  The Oberoi Cecil in Shimla was the ideal place to stay.    We took the train from Delhi to Kalka then the Toy Train -built during the British Raj in 1891- from Kalka to Simla.  It is a very long train journey Kalka to Simla by train takes about 5hrs and 30mn if there is no delay on the way.  You could also stop in various stations on the way to Simla and get a pre-booked taxi waiting at your designated stop.  We did not know that.  Anyhow, once at the hotel, we were welcomed by lovely Mandi with a hot chocolate and taken to our room.  The hotel is just splendid and its staff so friendly and caring.

I have to admit that the Cecil staff showered us with the best hospitality my wife and I have ever experienced. We are frequent 5 star travelers but nothing beats Oberoi. We felt that our minds are being read. Exceeded expectations in all fronts. Few names that i can recall: Sanuj: he welcomed, guided and explained us about the hotel etc..always helpful and smiling.  Prateek: again a gem of a guy ( he was being promoted as an F&B Manager ) and surely he deserved that. Raj Bhatia: The sous chef, also a very nice smiling humble person.

Attention to detail is their forte and I fully recommend a stay here on your itinerary. Special mention goes to RajKumar and all the catering staff for the excellent choice of food served. Just as well that our next stop is at a Health Resort to burn away these extra calories. The Bar Staff were also fantastic with their service.

This is a lovely hotel with a stunning hall/bar area.  The staff are discreet and always to hand.  We paid ¬£420 for 3 nights (Cox and King tour) upgrade to a Premium Valley Room.  Not sure this was worth it especially in February as you could not sit outside on the balcony (no table and chairs anyway). I asked for the windows to be cleaned and this was done but not until our third and last day. Given that the view is what you pay for this was a real lapse.

It has ben a mesmerising experience, be it the amenities, the food, the stay all had been truly 5 star.  Recommendation: Head Chef, Mr Raj Kumar, this gentleman ensures the food is prepared and served the way you like it. No words to explain the taste, the service and above all the luv with which it is prepared. Must try Butter Chicken, Mutton Rogan Josh with Roomali Roti, Paan and Kesar Pista Kulfi.

This is a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms and fantastic views.  As we were on a tour we decided to eat in the hotel and there was no where particularly near to go out.  The restaurant is large and can seem quite empty when only a few diners in there.  The first night the food was fine and they served a couple of extra courses which were very nice.  The second night the food  took a long time to be served and was luke warm when it arrived (the food isn't cheap here) and we ended up explaining this to 4 different people while the food was still sitting on the table.  They were very apologetic but by the time we had explained ourselves for the fourth time with the food now congeling on the table we didn't want it anymore.

Very few hotels have left me with a truly lasting impression but the Oberoi Cecil is one of them. It has great old style charm backed up by outstanding modern day service and amenities. It has wonderful views and a great position in beautiful Shimla a 10/15 minute leisurely walk from the Mall. I was told that this hotel was the first that Mr Oberoi worked in and subsequently bought so it has a great history.The hotel architecture is based around an atrium design - every room door faces the inner space and unfortunately some guests seem to think it's OK for their kids to run around the interior‚Ä¶",Date of stay: December 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

This heritage hotel is situated just on the edge of the main Shimla Mall - walking distance into town about 20 minutes - uphill.

"For our 6 month anniversary we decided to go to Shimla. Booking through the website, there was an issue initially from my mistake. The issue due to  miscommunication from the reservation team led to multiple emails with confusing room rates. However to their credit they resolved the matter before our travel to our satisfaction. Right from the time we reached the ISBT in  Shimla, the hotel didn't put a foot wrong. The rooms were excellent, however our room had no view and it was a let down. The furnishing, toiletries, in room dining was top notch. And yeah i forgot to mention that this was our first visit to an oberoi property having been in multiple Taj properties before. I can safely say the personal service given to us was way better than any Taj that i have stayed. Location‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The hotel  courtyard (now roofed over) is stunning.  The hotel is classical, traditional but modern.  The hotel staff are superb. Friendly, welcoming, helpful and very obliging.  We paid extra for a valley view room and were upgraded to a suite. It was worth every penny as we had a small balcony overlooking the valley and watched the sun rising and setting over the hills.  The hotel is well located at the end of town and is walking distance from the train station and all the shops. it is about a 40 to 45 minute walk from the far end of town back to the hotel.

The room was beautiful, we were right at the top in the eaves.  One thing that could be improved upon are the windows, they are single glazed and there is a bit of noise from outside, although this quietens after 11.  People who upgraded to get a valley view, as you're in the Himalayas here, were a bit aggrieved as they had the valley view but also the railway view!!  I'm sure in this day and age a solution could be found to put in some kind of' in keeping secondary glazing'.

The restaurant, although fairly large, had a lovely intimate feel when you had a table on the side by the window.   The food was totally delicious with a huge selection of pretty much anything you might like and the staff were wonderfully attentive.  The spa was also very good,although I rather wish they had put the prices on the spa menu.

The heated indoor swimming pool with the lounges offering valley view makes one feel nothing short of royalty.   And words fall short when one describes the unmatched hospitality of the staff.

The extensive use of architraves and skirtings in the Burma teak furniture and decor around the hotel lend an old world charm that is hard to match. The crystal chandeliers and the use of real silver cutlery in the restaurant add a royal touch.   Second the staff- The staff is super helpful yet not intrusive.

I had booked this hotel for a holiday in shimla. I knew everything what I was expecting. I knew this is the No. 1 hotel in Shimla. But one thing that amased me was the over employed staff which had a great enthusiasm towards the guests. I have not seen such a courteous hotel in my life time. Each and everything was so perfect. The children play area was very good. The room service was very quick. It was worth every rupee. Last but not the least I would like to mention about the best thing about the hotel and that is the restaurant. The staff at the restaurant was so polite and helpful. I think I may never see such a hospitality anytime soon.,Date of stay: July 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Visited this place for an official visit. Real pity that I could not fully explore and appreciate the beauty of the property... But in my limited time, have to give full marks to the hotel. The ambience, the restaurant and especially the service was just out of the world. Did I mention service... Oh yes... They really take care of you and know what u want even without you saying it. The location of the property is also good and very close to the main shopping areas...   The only downside would be the room size - found it a bit too cosy and small....

Mr. Nikhil and Mr. Samraj were always there to ensure they served and greeted us with a smile. They were helpful at every stage whenever we needed something.

Infact, the service which they deliver - makes Taj, Hyatt, ITC stand like wannabes.   Oberoi Cecil is a wonderful property with excellent decor, which is both classy and modern.

Right from the check in to the check out and everything in between, the Cecil reflects choicest hospitality which so perfectly reflects the brand. A stay here comes with a complimentary breakfast which is an extensive affair of Indian and Continental fare. But what makes the breakfast even better is the personalised touch that the F&B Manager Mark Manuel, Asst Manager Prateek Gulati and their team bring to it. Right from suggesting to actually goading the kids to try more, we saw it all. And this effort holds good for lunch and dinner at the restaurant as well.

The Oberoi Cecil has consistently stood for classic old world charm luxury. The team comprising of GM Amardeep Singh ably assisted by Prateek Gulhati and chefs Gurmeet Singh and Rajkumar Bhatia ensured the highest standards of impeccable hospitality. The menu is wide and varied. The section of ‚Äòunder 300 calories ‚Äò particularly interesting.  Seeing my keenness to get the recipes of the beetroot wrap and Burmese broth i was graciously invited into the main kitchen to see the live demo. This was followed by an interactive session on Himachali cuisine held by chef Rajkumar.Not only did he cook the various dishes in front of us but also shared valuable tips and gave us printed recipes of the same.

Cecil Oberoi is one of the most classic and old properties in Shimla. The Atrium of Cecil is gram and very Victorian and doesn't feel to impress you.

The room was very spacious with great view of the mountains. My wife wasn‚Äôt feeling well but the hotel went out of the way in looking after her and getting her relief medicines. We had light dinner at the Hotel which was very nice. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent and we were given 2 bottles of locally made marmalade and jam as a momento.

"Being a seasoned traveler, one of the best experiences I have ever had was at the Cecil Shimla. The hotel is situated in the midst of the town amongst thick pines. The view from the room was simply mesmerizing.

This is the only hotel in Shimla offering you a indoor heated swimming pool.

There is a charming indoor pool and the spa was outstanding.  It's about a 25 mins walk (uphill) to the Ridge in the centre of the historic town but the return trip is much easier.

It is very comfortable when you first entered with loungers and chairs around with fresh towels. When you enter the pool it is very warm easing all the aches of the day. The dining room has a similar view to our bedroom. Very luxurious with very friendly and efficient staff. If it wasn't on the menu they did their best to get it for you.

"Shimla was much colder than the other places in India that we'd visited around the Delhi area so it was good to have a lovely warm room with a comfortable bed.  Both the room and the bathroom were spotlessly clean with all the amenities you would expect in a 5 star hotel.  Our room was on the 5th floor with great views both outside and inside, looking down onto the bar area on the ground floor.  Top marks go to the indoor heated swimming pool - it was just heaven!  I don't know why there weren't more people using it but mostly I had it to myself.  The food in this hotel was excellent;  we had pizza in the bar area one night (because we'd had a huge lunch in Shimla) which was excellent, and the second night we ate a la carte and I had the best meal of my stay in India, a mushroom‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everything was perfect. We were welcomed with hot chocolate. There was fresh fruit in the room. Every evening the bed covers were turned down and a weather report for the next day was placed in the room. The breakfast was amazing (fantastic poached eggs) as was our evening meal - try the green risotto. The staff made you very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.

There was a separate area with cupboard space and ample room for suitcases. The bedroom was delightful. We had a room on the fifth floor with fantastic view and everything worked perfectly. I cannot think of anything I would fault.  Breakfast was a good choice with a buffet service and menu. We had both the buffet and a la carte for dinner. They also prepared something special for my husband who was feeling off colour.

They were also very astute in making dining recommendations for us.  We had a corner room, on the fifth floor, and it was lovely.  There was a separate luggage room, which made our main bedroom very comfortable.  A good experience.  Yes, the monkeys are about but we followed recommendations and kept our windows shut.

We were fortunate to be upgraded to a luxury room, but all the facilities were outstanding - beautiful views over Shimla. Food excellent, but the outstanding feature was the staff and their service. Nothing was too much trouble and they were not looking for tips all of the time, because they had a central gratuity policy and actively discouraged individual tipping.

Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while part of a Great Train trip and just walking into the lounge was awesome. The open atrium really showed the opulence of when it was built and over a century later still manages to impress. You can always find something to gripe about due to the decor or maintenance and although some of these weren't perfect they were minor concerns. The major irritation were related to sound in the atrium with the afternoon pianist who either wasn't good enough (a lot of duff notes) or a piano that needed retuning. Our room was on the 4th floor of the atrium and sound of the pianist and the canned pipe music carried very well into the room due to insufficient soundproofing.

This is one of those hotels that spoils you for staying anywhere else.  The staff here are first class and could teach the rest of the world a thing or two about customer service.  Beautiful rooms and fantastic service from everyone.  Delightful spa with indoor pool. Massages were great.  The food was extraordinary.  On our second night they were not busy and the restaurant manager offered to present us with a selection of the local foods rather than have to choose and this was included in our voucher!  The food was exceptional! We left looking forward immensely to our next Oberoi Hotel.,Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
The problem with staying at the oberois is its difficult to stay with other hotels in future as service standards and hospitality are of an unimaginable level .. When you check in it feels like walking into your drawing room as you are ushered straight to your room rather than showing your identity papers at the front desk and that starts the unique experience of your stay.. The food served by the restaurant is more like you are in your dining room with a personal chef Mr. Raj Kumar Bhatia ( he is so down to earth and caring that everybody gets the feel he is your tables personal chef) and the best part about the chef is his infectious energy and charm.. I did not open the menu card as he was our cook book and just followed his suggestions to the T..

"A charming hotel with true colonial feel. It was very cold in Shimla and the first thing that strikes one is the warm and welcoming fireplace at the Oberoi Cecil.  The staff are extremely well trained and hospitality is at its best.  The rooms were clean; the bathroom had a bath tub and was extremely clean too.  Bedding and toiletries were classy. They have a pillow menu which is a must try. The housekeeping staff  are amazingly prompt and extremely well trained. They have knowledge about the pillows to help you choose and their communication skills are impeccable..!!  Don't forget to pack your swimsuits 'coz they have a heated pool close to the spa.

"The Hotel is well located off Mall Road in Shimla, we were greeted at the door by the CSR who thankfully took us to our room to be checked in instead of having us wait at a counter, this was a welcome relief given the hours of travel which we had been going through. The Staff at every point did everything they could to accommodate us from arranging transportation, to extending dining hours in the lounge because I was unwell and my mum sleeping in the room meant that I couldn't order room service.   We had an excellent session with Chef Raj who taught us three dishes and ensured to send us the recipes and even more after (as well as other lovely gifts to take back to Trinidad and Tobago).

Checking in was very quick with staff finishing formalities in the guest room itself so as to not make us waiting after the long journey. Staff at the front desk were courteous and attentive.  During reservation I had to book 2 rooms, one for us & one for children. Deluxe rooms are pretty small. Bathrooms are nice with excellent toiletries and cozy bathrobes.

"Had heard so much about how wonderful this hotel was but it didnt quite live up to expectations.  In the photograph it looks like its in the middle of a forest but is in fact directly on a main road.  All public spaces are very nice, especially the atrium lounge/bar but the prices for drinks were the highest we had on our entire trip.  Our bedroom was very noisy as it was facing the main road, directly above the entrance.  It was also very cold.  When we got into bed the sheets were like ice and there were no extra blankets provided but a long list of how many different type of pillows you could ask for.

Beyond the exquisite hotel and its historical charm, the professionalism and service from the Oberoi team is classy and efficient. On my most recent trip a family emergency came up, and the Cecil team went above and beyond to ensure we immediately got a taxi to Delhi and also a reservation at a sister Oberoi at extremely short notice.

"Having recently experienced our stay in this hotel leaves no doubt as why this property has such excellent reviews. Hotel lives to each and every positive review in totality. To begin my review, just a small word of alert for discerning travelers. The most prominent photograph of the hotel on the hotel website for its exterior view is actually the backside of the hotel. That side is not accessible from the hotel or otherwise. This exterior has beautiful facade of the building and is surrounded by thick forest. The actual exterior view of the front side of the hotel is good but not as beautiful as the backside. So the hotel front-side is on the main road and building looks average from the outside.

Then we met Mr Prateek Gulati at the restaurant who knew every prepration in the menu and made excellent suggestions too. A very humble guy. Thanks a ton.

Whilst doubtless steeped in history the rooms on the road side of the hotel are very very noisy.  Granted they are quite a bit quieter at night when there are some restrictions on access and egress to the road but during the day the noise spoils the enjoyment of the room.  Apparently the only way to get away from this is to pay more money subject to availability.  Whilst the staff were lovely the service was extremely slow, even by India's standards.  It was not uncommon to have to request drinks/ orders from the bar several times before they arrived.

Its difficult to pick out outstanding employees as everyone from reception, pool staff, waiters etc were perfect ambassadors for Oberoi.  However a special mention has to go to the assistant manager, Prateek, who did an outstanding job of looking after us.

"The Oberoi Cecil is a step back in time.  Wonderful feel of an english manor, with the touches of beautiful Shimla.  Our family stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, wish it could have been more.  The entire staff was extremely helpful and took care of all of our needs.  From the front desk, to the wonderful bartender, restaurant service, indoor pool service, guest floor attendants and chauffeurs, the entire team was there to make this trip most enjoyable.  When choosing a ""top 10"" hotel in Shimla, be careful.  We chose another ""top 10"" hotel on our first night in Shimla, and was very disappointed.  The manager at the Cecil was great in getting our bags from our first hotel, and setting us up with a superb room at the Cecil.  The Cecil is more expensive, but well worth the money.",Date of stay: July 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

But I would like make a a special mention about the Sous Chef , Mr. Rajkumar Bhatia. His services are just out of this world. His food is very tasty of course. But its the love and affection that he shows while serving which is outstanding.

The hotel looks very dominant on the hillside as you approach by train but the rear on the road seems a little drab but it all changes when you get inside. The interior is all dark wood and open space, the middle of the hotel is like an indoor courtyard with the rooms round the outside, very much how I imagined the colonial style would be. We stayed here for 3 nights on a B&B basis with one dinner as a Shimla extension on a tour of the Golden Triangle so I can't comment on the cost of the accommodation.

Having stayed in many of the 5 star properties in India and abroad over the years, I can easily say the warmth that we received from the staff in this hotel will stay fresh in our mind for a long time. Check in was very quick , the welcome drink was very refreshing. There was so much attention given to detail that we were asked for our preferred newspaper. Room was well appointed and cosy with Colonial era setting  . We ordered lunch through room service and were pleasantly surprised when complimentary desserts were sent for us .

One of the best kept properties of Oberoi. The overall experience at the Oberoi Cecil has been OUTSTANDING.   Mr Vishal (GM) of the hotel is doing an immaculate job of running this property. This hotel has a very motivated and proactive staff. Mr Vishal approached us personally to ensure our stay is comfortable right from the check-in to the daily breakfasts.   Ms. Kunjan at the front desk is highly professional and took personal interest in guiding us through right from the check-in to everyday excursions.   The Restaurant staff is extremely pleasing and took personal interest to ensure my 2 kids I was travelling with are well taken care of including the food that they would like to experience.

"Words fail me in saying how positive our experience was at The Oberoi Cecil.   From the very start we felt we were given the royal treatment.   As we sat in the atrium being greeted by the manager, an excellent man ( I want to say his name is Protik) sorted out our booking. He was equally as diligent and lovely in checking us out at the end of our stay. There was an immediate sense of welcome and an empathy for us as guests, a connection.   The accommodation we were given was stunningly luxurious and to say we were happy is an understatement. It exceeded expectation.   All the staff were so incredibly pleasant and helpful.

Fabulous hotel with great location. Away from the noise of the Mall Road. Excellent hospitality. Super friendly staff.

This was the last but one stop on our trip to India. The hotel was great and a good end to our holiday.  The room we had was in the older part of the hotel and had a balcony with a fantastic view down the the valley. The room was spotless and very comfortable and the hotel provided free bottles of water. The service in the hotel was excellent - one little thing worth mentioning was that when I left a phone charger cable out they copied it and put a Velcro cable tidy on it - such was the level of detail.  The restaurant had both a la carte and buffet. We ate and the buffet all 3 nights as it was very good value for money.

Oberoi Propoerties are known for their hospitality and on this visit I got to experience it.   Cecil is a lovely property in Shimla run by some very lovely people.   They will do everything possible to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.   The rooms are big and spacious.   The only negative is that the property is not very disabled friendly. The lifts don't go to the spa/swimming level and the luxury rooms don't have option of showers for ppl who are not able to climb into the bath tubs but in our case the staff tried to provide solutions wherever  possible and am a very happy customer.,Date of stay: May 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

If one can afford don't miss booking it. It's ideally located right before the tunnel when you enter the Shimla City. A five start hotel with vintage charm makes you feel full of that winter warmth of hills even during summers.  Rooms are spacious and comfy. Kids and amenities for adults are sufficient. Very nice property. Easy access to mall road. The restaurant set up is good while you can have lunch over looking the Shimla railway station. During breakfast you get a chance to have a glimpse of the old toy train plying on the track. We had an amazing experience during our stay in this beautiful property.

The Cecil overlooks the Shimla Valley which gives most of the rooms are spectacular view. Shimla was the summer residence of the viceroy during colonial times.

The rooms are well appointed. The restaurant offers great flavours lovingly served.,Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"We stayed four nights in this beautiful,old, atmospheric hotel. The rooms were large and comfortable with wonderful views. The public spaces full of character. The weather was unseasonably cold , the room and hotel was cold. They gave us some plug in heaters for the room but the corridor and public areas were decidedly chilly.  However the service was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant and bar could not do enough to be accommodating especially with my wife's problem diet. The chef personally looked after her needs.  The position of the hotel was Convenient for walking into town.  A very special place to stay which we will remember.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We had 3 days in Shimla at the end of a tour of northern India and the Oberoi Cecil was an ideal choice of hotel. The location is convenient, on the edge of town but relatively quiet surroundings and everything about the hotel exudes restrained luxury and comfort. Service was uniformly excellent and staff went out of their way - particular mention for Kalifa who is there for a couple of months as part of his management training. Food and drink are good but expensive (like most hotels we stayed in). At least there are alternative places to eat out nearby in town if inclined. Indoor pool is very good and we heard great things about the spa but the steam room could do with sprucing up and some new/better equipment in the gym would be good. Also, the main bar could do with more‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"This hotel is not only historical but the service is way above my expectation. The room is spacious and clean towels, bath ropes & tip top housekeeping. Staff in the restaurant are ever so attentive and very friendly n provide excellent service. The lobby bar is spacious and welcoming. The gym is fantastic and comes with a lovely heated swimming pool. This is a hotel that makes me so welcome and I will definitely come back to Shimla. Keep up the brilliant service, all staff at Oberoi Cecil.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Arrived here having suffered a severe migraine attack whilst on the toy train. Staff couldn't have been more helpful getting me up to my room and didn't try to make me sit through welcome drinks. The hotel is very clean throughout and the staff both in reception are all excellent. Bar snacks are available in the large open bar/lounge area although you do have to put up with a truly dreadful piano player. Good selection of food served buffet style and hot breakfasts can be cooked to order. The swimming pool is downstairs and not overlooked. Plenty of towels and comfortable loungers if you just want to sit and read a book out of the heat. Rooms are a decent size and there is a nice dressing area separate to the bathroom. Bath was very small but the shower is good.,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"In Shimla, our family stayed at the Oberoi Cecil Hotel, the first hotel Mr. Oberoi bought.  The Oberoi chain is now one of the world‚Äôs most luxurious.  Most of the Oberoi hotels are in India, but they have hotels in Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other locations.  The Cecil has a multi-story lobby, which is quite impressive.  It has a spa our daughter and son-in-law enjoyed.  The hotel was built in two stages and has a somewhat odd and inconvenient  elevator system, because of which you have to take an elevator and stairs to the restaurant if your room is in the building addition.    Our room was great. It had a comfortable bed, a desk, two easy chairs and wonderfully bright light for reading. There was a separate entry, a large closet, and a dressing room with more closet‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Our stay at Cecil was superb.  We were overwhelmed with the warmth and hospitality of the team.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The food was really good.  The kids had a good time at the activity centre.  The view from our room was spectacular.  Situated right opposite the Shimla Railway station, staying at this hotel helped us go for the Hertiage Walk 1 covering Mall road all the way to the Viceregal Lodge. My recommendation would be to stay at the old block which has it own unique charm and a bit of heritage",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"What a place this is! From the wonderful staff, to the interior decor, this hotel is impossible to fault. The rooms are gorgeous, and very luxurious.

Everyone should stay here at least once.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"From the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble, all the staff were so genuinely helpful, polite and caring. The views from our room were just stunning. Food was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. It made a fitting finale to our amazing holiday. We cannot speak highly enough of this jewel in Shimla. We will in future look to stay with this group where-ever possible.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The room was majestic, spacious, well furnished and heated as temperatures were low in Shimla.  Since we were celebrating a special anniversary, the housekeeping staff had decorated our room with flowers and a cake. A great gesture we will remember. Every member of the staff was always doing their best . The food was outstanding. Thanks to Exec Chef Gurmeet Bhamra who was there at every meal and cooked up some really fantastic food for us. Something we will really miss. Thanks to each and every staff member for a great stay",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. We had a superb room with excellent views towards the Himalayas. The food was very good and a very attractive lounge and bar area. The mall is walkable from the hotel but better coming back as it is downhill. It has a nice swimming pool and leisure facilities.,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Only one night spent here during a business trip (via the toy train) but it was a very pleasant one. The building is very grand and has authentic decor that gives one a glimpse of how the privileged lived 100+ years ago in days of the Raj. The room was very comfortable and the highlights were the amazing views from the room over the Himalayan foothills. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and could not do enough to help us. I wish I could have stayed longer so I could explore this fascinating building much more.,Date of stay: January 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Our first time in an Oberoi. It will not be our last. LOVED this hotel and wish it was closer to home so we could go regularly. This was a phenomenal experience. The hotel is beautiful in appearance, very different. Rooms elegant. Staff amazing and I mean outstanding. They just never stopped going the extra mile for us. From Lee doing check in, in our room, to Vineet in the dining room and Jatin who took endless care of me when I was not feeling well. The staff all speak excellent English and are knowledgeable and educated.  Manoj at front desk was SO helpful. Our maid, Chiranjit, was delightful. We were truly sorry to leave.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"It is a luxury hotel but has only the facilities of a hotel. One should not expect services of a vacation resort or anything near. However, the staff is very polished and services are awesome. The food tastes average as compared to other hotels of the same category but the buffet has a variety to offer. The polite and efficient staff is the specialty of this hotel and which is obvious when Oberoi group is concerned.",Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
The Oberoi  are the best in the hospitality world ... superb location and a wonderful warm welcoming staff and the surrounding of the hotel. a child friendly place with lots to do in the hotel in spite of not being very big in space ... rooms are big and very will managed with all basic facilities and in very good conditions. have maintained  the colonial structure which adds to the history and the wooden floors with its wood work all around put in the warmth in the place. an indoor swimming pool heated which a big great plus point in all seasons ...  near the Mall road not to far and 25 minutes walk which is a wonderful walk not on the maim high way but between the green patch of trees. a excellent kids or recreation place with  pool table doll house and games and books all in‚Ä¶,Date of stay: August 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Spent three nights at this hotel during a tour of India.  It is definitely one of the best hotels in Shimla.  My room was large and I also had a dressing room.  The furniture was of a good quality.    There was a good indoor swimming pool, but no outside sitting area as the hotel was built on a steep hill.  The hotel was about 30 minutes walk from Scandal Point at the centre of Shimla.  The bar in the atrium was reasonably priced for food and drink given the hotel quality.  Dinner in the restaurant, though good, was on the pricey side.  Service was very good.  The hotel is very stylish and colonial in feel.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"The Oberoi's are at its best again. To start with an excellent staff to welcome you. The moment you reach there you get a very warm welcome. Thereafter throughout the stay the staff makes best of the efforts to make it most comfortable. On entering the room the staff had kept a few cookies with welcome note along with name of my children written with chocolate. That was simply amazing. Thereafter as about the dining, the staff is simply superb. Not only the food is delicious but everyone out there makes sure that everything is to the taste of the person dining. Any review is taken very seriously and corrective action taken immediately. Not to miss out on amazing swimming pool, spa and entertainment room for children. An amazing place to go.",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"After our 11-hour day travelling we were delighted to arrive at The Oberoi Cecil. What a wonderful hotel, even if we did change rooms after one night as, in our first room, we were sandwiched between a road some 20 feet away on one side, and the bar, with its piano and the general hubbub of a busy hotel, 15 feet from the door of the room on the other. The hotel staff were superb and arranged the transfer to a room higher up without a hitch. The dining room was excellent and it took the staff no time at all to get to know us and even reserve a specific table near a window for us. We had the swimming pool to ourselves initially. It was very well appointed and virtually at blood heat! The hotel also checked us in for our onward flight with very little fuss at all. They very kindly‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We've just got back from 3 nights at the Cecil and it was truly amazing. Staff are fantastic and very very helpful. Rooms are spotless and very beautiful. I could have stayed longer. Exceptional!

"We had three wonderful day at the Hotel Cecil Oberoi.     We have enjoyed staying at all the Oberoi Hotels which we have visited, and this was certainly no exception.   It's location is superb - just far enough away from the hubbub, but within pleasant walking distance of both the Mall and the Viceroy's lodge.     The views from all bedrooms are superb and the air.     The waiting staff deserve special praise for their attentive service.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Couldn't fault this hotel. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and well looked after.

I would stay here again.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Others have extolled the qualities of the Cecil and I would agree with all that has been said. The service is truly world class (eg, when we checked in my wife was suffering from a cold/hoarseness and they immediately brought her an Indian grog - peppermint tea with fresh ginger and honey - which helped tremendously). The rooms are large and luxurious, great lounge/bar area. Wood floors and hotel interior has history dripping from the walls, but very thing in the rooms is updated. Not the prettiest hotel on the outside and there is no outside space to speak of (then again you are the top of a mountain), but otherwise a perfect place to stay and enjoy the town of shimla.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a group tour, and it was lovely. The rooms are old style wood panelled, and are all centred around the full height atrium. All of the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the cocktails in the bar are delicious.  The hotel has a lovely indoor swimming pool (which is buried deep underneath but with fabulous views) and the dining room is lovely.  The only real downside - which is a minor criticism - is that the service at breakfast was a tad slow sometimes.  Overall however we loved this hotel.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
The hotel is great and the staff can't do enough to help their guests. This was as part of an organised trip and the food and facilities were extremely good. Bar service also very good.

"We stayed at this hotel during a short stay in Shimla as part of a private tour of northern India. As expected for an Oberoi hotel the building, rooms, facilities and staff were excellent. A nice touch was that no tipping was allowed during our stay but a tip was to be left at reception in an envelope upon departure to be shared by all the staff. The standard of our room was very good with nice touches like fresh fruit being provided. We didn't eat in the restaurant other than breakfast but would suspect from the bar prices this would be very expensive. It is a good 20 minute walk to the shopping mall up and down hills so you'll need to be reasonably fit if you are walking out for a meal in the evening.

"From the moment we arrived for our 3 night stay were made to feel special. The hotel is classy and elegant with service to match. Staff are superbly trained achieving that difficult balance between great service and being over eager and intrusive. Freshly made pastries in the lounge with afternoon tea, lovely buffet breakfast with everything freshly baked and cooked to order. Too often hotels try to provide too wide a range at breakfast and quality suffers. Not here, everything superb! The dining experience whether having the buffet or a la carte was also excellent.  We were given a valley view room which provided stunning views over the to the surrounding mountains.

"This is an old hotel, obviously updated by the Oberoi chain. It has still kept a lot of the charm, and can easily be pictured, as it would have been before 1947. Very good, quality hotel. The staff excellent, nothing too much trouble.  Some rooms are adjacent to the bar, coffee shop area, so could be a little noisy at times. Indoor pool and gym.

"A beautiful hotel with a beautiful service.   We stayed here in Dec 2016 and we fully enjoyed our stay.   Starting from their services at the bar where you can sit and enjoy the drinks while listening to the piano played by a very talented gentleman.   Breakfast had everything that we craved for and more. Lunch was served with specialities. Dinner needless to say!  The swimming pool is big and warm and the staff on duty were very helpful. They served us fresh fruits and took good care of us.  Special thanks to Kashish, Chiranjit and Dixit at the restaurant. Also to Rinchin for the lovely coats.  Keep up the good work Oberoi. You are always my First Choice!",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"This is a beautiful hotel, fabulous service and staff, one of the nicest bedrooms I have seen in any hotel, but more than this there is a great sense of calm about the place, on entering the stunning foyer it was like leaving the world outside. Valley view rooms are recommended as the vista is vast, and worthwhile, a little road noise but not enough to disturb. I agree with previous reviewer the manager is key and he is a visible presence talking to and greeting guests personally, a nice touch. Loved every minute we were there.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
This is a great hotel in a great location with friendly staff and facilities.  Our room had a view down the valley and the breakfasts were excellent.  The only actual fault was that the dinner buffet was a bit ordinary.  The other perceived fault was that we had stayed the night before at the sister hotel The Wildflower which would put any other hotel in the world in the shade.,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"This is a heritage hotel at the quieter end of The Mall in Shimla.  The wow factor is the bar area which is vaulted to the roof with internal balconies leading to the rooms.  Very, very comfortable rooms as you'd expect in a hotel of this class. What made this hotel stand out for us was the service, especially in the restaurant.  The waiters were so helpful and could not do enough for you.  My wife had a fall while in India which necessitated four stitches.  One of the waiters brought her some turmeric, which is good for healing, and then it arrived without asking at every subsequent meal, even when the waiter was on his day off! Highly recommended.",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

If you watched the series even though it wasn't filmed here this is heaven from heaven. We had been upgraded to an executive suite room 211 if you get the chance go for it.  If you want to feel like you are a member of royalty then this is it.  Everything was totally impeccable.  It was one of those pinch us moments.  Very relaxing.  Could have stayed a few more days.

Absolutely Fabulous.",Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Just great rooms and comfortable beds made for a very cosy stay in Shimla.

Under the watchful eye of GM Vishal Pathak this Oberoi meets and exceeds all expectations.

Nothing is too much trouble -my wife mad a passing comment it might be a little cool at this height...within an hour, a present was delivered to our room...a woollen cardigan! Lovely food (a la carte, even on half board). If you can afford it, choose a Valley view room with a balcony - you  wont regret it! BUT...watch out for the monkeys which climb up or down to your balcony and bang on the door! Unfortunately, being perched high on a ridge, there is no garden but you can sit at a private table outside the front with a drink (no food...monkeys!) and a uniformed member of staff with a big stick stands beside you to ensure the monkeys don't bother you!",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Stayed here for 3 days during our tour of india... this is the place to relax after all the bustle of Delhi and Jaipur. Its a lot cooler up here and everyone seems a lot calmer. The staff cannot do enough to make your stay really enjoyable. The hotel seems to base itself on the old colonial style with lots of wood decoration. The rooms are good size with the usual amenities, comfortable and well laid out. Our room had a balcony but no furniture to sit and relax and enjoy the fabulous views, we were warned to keep the doors shut as they have a monkey problem invading the rooms.

The swimming pool is very welcoming especially after a day trekking round Shimla or treat yourself to one of the many treatments in the spa - again highly recommended,  I have experienced spa treatments in many well known places but the 3 hour rejuvenate treatment at The Cecil is to be recommended and the price is very reasonable compared‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"The Oberoi Shimla is a perfect place to stay with all modern facilities. It is within walking distance of the heritage area. The service was perfect and food very good. It must be noted Shimla is quite tiring to get to. The hotel itself is staffed by people who genuinely seem to smile, and enjoy their job, not the normal hotel greeting smile. It has a good indoor pool, which is really warm. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. To get back to Delhi we took the toy train half way. The views were lovely, from there we took a car. Shimla itself is hard to get around as there are cars everywhere,   And nearly impossible to park.",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We stayed for 3 nights here all of the facilities were first class, the food in the resturant was superb and nothing was to much bother for the lads in the restaurant.

"After spending two nights at the secluded Oberoi Wild Flower Hall about 45 minutes away, my wife and I decided to spend two more nights in the hills but near ""civilization"" & Oberoi Cecil turned out to be a perfect location..  The Mall (the marketplace for the elite during the British colonial era) was a thirty minute walk from the hotel with plenty of historic places to discover on the way.  The hotel itself was a small boutique type property, spotlessly clean and very well appointed.  We took the ""premiere"" room which came with a balcony overlooking the valley and we found this to be a great bonus.  The staff, as with all Oberoi properties, was very well trained and went out of their way to make us feel at home.

Built on the site of Kipling's old home in Shimla the Oberoi is a stunning place to stay.  The central lounge / bar is stunning with its atrium style shape.

"We had a wonderful stay at The Oberoi Cecil in Shimla. The hotel is a beautifully restored heritage hotel in a magnificent setting within the foothills of the Himalayas in Shimla. Every member of staff that we encountered was courteous, attentive and professional and you can tell that everyone takes great pride in the hotel. We were chatting to the hotel manager about the history of the hotel and the inspiring story of M. S. Oberoi who founded the hotel chain, and when we got back to our room there was a copy of M. S. Oberoi's biography for us to take home. The hotel has a very fair tipping policy whereby you can leave a common tip at the end of your stay and it is shared across all of the staff.

I can eat only the mildest of curry I told her when i was chatting she said she would place and order in the kitchen and produced a chicken dinner 15 minutes later.

"Stayed 4 nights at the Cecil after 10 hectic days in other parts of India. Find it difficult to fault the way we were looked after. All the team at the Cecil went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable experience . Well equipped room with a great view . Ate in the restaurant each evening, food was very good with a very wide choice ( & not just Indian food ). The white chocolate desert is one of the best I have ever had!! Strongly recommend the Cecil. It delivers the complete package and in such a friendly way. If I want to find fault, they have no outside space to go and sit, however the lounge with its "" vaulted ceiling "" is an impressive area as an alternative. Well done to all at the Cecil.",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We agreed the Oberoi Cecil is by far the best hotel we have stayed at for as long as we can remember, even taking account of luxurious hotels in Dubai and some spectacular hotels in NZ. Shimla is a lovely unique part of India and the Cecil takes advantage of its situation to provide outstanding views and scenery. The internal d√©cor and ambiance is of a colonial style hotel and the main bar/reception area is particularly grand.

My memorable moments was seeing an LG fridge freezer being carried on the back of a coolie, and riding on a very overcrowded local mini bus which cost 20p. Visited the former Viceroy's residence.

"Well, let me get this straight- services in all Oberoi properties are great and standardised, and this property too stood to the Oberoi service expectations.  Having said that, this property has a fatal flaw - no open area or deck to enjoy the outdoors While the property has an old world charm, it does seem unfair not to have any place to enjoy the scenic beauty and you are forced to step out to the commercial mall of Shimla for the experience.

We arrived late in Shimla having done the first half of the toy train up from Kalka. (the first 2 hours on the train hold a bit of novelty but the prospect a further 4 hours of crowded backside ache and wheel squeak was terrible and our guide rescued us as she does with most people) The hotel is very grand and furnished to a very high quality and service is very good and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. On the first night we were hungry and tired so opted to eat in the rather grand dining room. A few beers and a couple of bottles of wine and 3 started 3 main courses and few extras and we had a bill in the order of ¬£280. I dont mind paying good money for a great meal but ¬£280 for a curry!

"A throwback to the days of he Raj, a utterly beautiful and luxurious hotel. We stopped only for lunch on a day trip to Shimla and were initially struck by the ambience created by having Beethoven's 5th piped around the lower floors of the hotel - including the toilets! We soon realised, however, that we were hearing only the first movement - over and over again. Despite the problems with obtaining cash in India, you would have though they would have been able to change just 1000 rupees to pay for the drinks at lunch - but they couldn't (or rather, surely, wouldn't). By the way - the (just short of) 1000 rupees - more than ¬£12 sterling - was for three small bottles of mineral water!!!",Date of stay: November 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

They dried our swimsuits that we're hanging in the shower, they gave us extra water bottles when they saw how much we drank, and even sent our kid's pants back when we forgot it. I loved the old world charm of the place and unfortunately it was the only thing I liked in Shimla (the rest of the town was uninspiring and dilapidated, totally not worth the immense effort to go up there).

The staff were wonderful and could not do enough to help with any request.  Our room was clean, spacious and tastefully decorated in a manner that befitted the age of the Hotel.

We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour and therefore cannot comment on the room rate. There is definitely a colonial atmosphere at this hotel.  It had a lovely wooden feel to the interior and the dinning was excellent.  Perhaps we were unlucky with the room allocation a we were in the original building.  This was not served adequately with a lift and needed stairs to get to reception or the restaurant.  My wife has asthma and struggled a bit as the air at Shimla is thinner than on the plains.

This hotel suits Shimla with its colonial Raj history. A building full of character and that history close to the town centre. The unusual galleried landings in the bar and lounge create a unique atmosphere. Whilst it does not tick all the Oberoi  top of the hotel range boxes it certainly delivers a very high level of professional service in a warm and friendly style.

I simply loved this property. It has an old time charm to it. Its located off the mall which is both an advantage (away from the crowd) and a disadvantage (if you want to go to the mall regularly).

"Oberoi hotels are usually exceptional, the Cecil is not. Our room was very good, lovely view, comfortable and well serviced. The swimming pool is equally good. The issues that bring this hotel down are twofold, first it is used heavily by package tour groups which tends to create cliques/ guide led forums and the dining area seems segregated to accommodate them. In addition the hotel provides a nightly buffet aimed at tour groups. Secondly the restaurant is just not up to Oberoi standards.

The best way to enjoy seeing Shimla is to spend some time here and then move on to the Wildflower in Mashobra to get away from noise and people and traffic.

We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The service was excellent. Let me start with housekeeping. We stayed in room 301. The housekeeper was very observant and anticipated our needs. Simple thing like water. First day there were 2 bottles ond 2 in the fridge. We use bottle water to brush our teeth. Next day there was 4 bottles üëç. The housekeeper even tied my USB charger cables neatly üëç. Our shoes were even placed all in one spot. Next the restaurant - all the staff were extremely helpful with a smile. Special mention of a trainee chef Tina Sharma. She was always willing to go the extra mile for us.

"This hotel isn't much better than any other in the area.  For what you get, this place is ridiculously overpriced.  For the price they charge per night, you can rent a big house in Shimla.  Their rooms are just okay.  In our room, the windows were covered by a white tint, so you could hardly see outside.  Upon opening the windows you notice a slum-like area, making one guilty to even pay $300 plus per night that we paid.  It is too far from the action on Mall Road, where everything is located.   The service we received was inferior, as they could not properly fix the A/C in our room for two days and we barely had time to keep asking.  That is the reason for the poor rating.

Basically, the hotel is like any other which claims to have the kind of rating that The Oberoi Cecil lays claims to. Of course, it has an old-world charm if you pay attention to the construction of the hotel, particularly to the use of high-quality woodwork every where. Having said that, when you pay the kind of money that they charge, you expect everything to be spot on. You don't expect to find dirty drapes in your room, dirty walls of the balcony and broken glass on the ornamental door leading to the room. Further, the bathroom fittings are from an age gone by.

"Just had a fabulous fortnight in this heritage hotel which has stood on this site for decades and is rated one of the top twenty in the world. Though the monsoons were starting the weather was great most of the time and sitting on your balcony watch the clouds gather and disperse at 7,500 feat up in the Himalayas is a unique experience.  As with any holiday the key thing is the staff and how well they provide service. The manager, Vishal Pathak, is a very obvious presence in the hotel and visits most tables during the evening meals.

"Cecil is one of three properties owned by luxury group Oberoi in Shimla. While Wildflower Hall tends to be the choice of Honeymooners and people looking for peace and serenity, Cecil excels in its central location.  Historically, The Cecil is a bit of a monument in itself. It has been witness to many state guests and celebrities from British era and continues to serve the well-healed luxury clientele with its impeccable service.   Rooms are well laid out but be warned of the monkey menace in town and please keep all windows shut at all times. Also, it is advisable to book valley view rooms as they will also shield you from traffic noise.  The staff is very attentive and accommodating. Kids' room is huge and has every imaginable toys/games for a toddler to a young adult. ‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
I stayed at the Oberoi Cecil Hotel alongwith my family in the first week of July. We had a wonderful stay and the service provided by the staff was impeccable. The food at the restaurant was sumptuous and the chef and the restaurant staff catered to our demands.We were upgraded to a lavish suite with a breathtaking view of the Simla hills. This trip brought back old memories as I had previously  stayed at this hotel few years ago. I must say that Oberoi hotels are iconic in that they live up to their reputation and provide a unique service to their customers. I would definitely stay at this hotel on my next trip to Simla.,Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The hotel property has a heritage feel. The staff are extremely cordial and helpful to the core. We stayed for 4 days.  The hotel was kind enough to give the kids  food ( two kids below 2 yrs) complimentary.  However the food prices are TOO EXPENSIVE and rates were higher then the prices in a five star in Mumbai. Could not understand the reason for the same.  Oberoi needs to improve the quality of food  drastically if it wants to remain in top 10 hotels in India.  This is one hotel that can be skipped.

Cecil is probably one of the finest hotels in Shimla. Within the Oberoi brand though it is overshadowed by the wonderful Wildflower in terms of the offerings from a price / quality perspective.

The entire hotel is very courteous. The Valley view rooms are a good choice though usually getting them is a challenge because they are few in number. If you are a budget traveller this may not be the place.

All other staff were extremely polite and very well mannered and very well trained. Only a very small disappointment was that the Wifi was provided for half an hour, the reason being,we had booked through an agent and paid the full rates. For the same reason discount for spa to residents was also not offered. Vishal the manager very kindly upgraded us to valley view rooms. All in all, an excellent and memorable experience.

The hotel also has one of the best maintained swimming pools you will find in Himachal, and their breakfast spread is one of the best I have found across India.

The main course included Chicken dhauladhari, chaa ghost, khatte moong ki dal, channa dish and another vegetarian dish with pulao and 2 portions of breads. In the desserts they served gulab jamun.

The drive up from the Chandigarh airport took about 4 hours and was a terrifying mix of near-misses and harrowing turns. Our Oberoi driver was excellent, but between road construction, landslides, indomitable buses, blind curves and the occasional meandering cow, we felt our life was in the hands of whichever god is protector of travelers.

We stayed in Room 401. It was a large room with more than the usual furnishings. There was a settee, 2 chairs and a desk. There was an unusual cupboard housing the kettle and tea and coffee supplies, which were replaced when requested. A small amount of fresh fruit was in the room and there was a daily free newspaper. The large wardrobe included a safe. The king size bed was very comfortable and a choice of pillows was offered. The plentiful supply of complimentary bottled water was replenished every day.

We pre-booked 2 rooms for 2 couples. The hotel staff was courteous and kind. The rooms were clean; not much spacious. Washroom fittings were loose and didn't function properly. Even short visit to washroom gave sense of claustrophobia in there. Clear signs of construction ageing all around.  No great views from the rooms we were given. Spa and pool facilities are great. There is an indoor heated pool. Steam bath is also available.  Food was not up to the mark and lacked taste.

We did have some issues with the food being served at the restaurant but after the feedback was shared, the team was prompt enough to take good care of us. The team under Mr Pathak (GM) is doing a great job. The only point worth mentioning is that while the hotel charges so much for the stay, the free wifi is offered only for 30 minutes in a  day. this was a let down.

It's a short steep walk above the Shimla railway station though you will arrive by taxi I'm sure.  The hotel has a sort of informal colonial clubby atmosphere. Rooms were staff. Staff were outstanding and the hotel restaurant was perfect with excellent dinners and breakfasts and tables with outstanding views.  The vast majority of Shimla is within a pleasant twenty minute walk so you dont neccessarily need a driver here and the hotel can fix one in any case.

The food at the restaurant is also good, during the dinner buffet they took care to provide us some additional dishes which were not part of the menu. The heated pool and the kids activity centre are additional attractions for the kids, they have attendants at the activity centre all the time. Being closer to the state assembly, the mobile signal strength is very poor and need to depend on hotel wifi only which is way too expensive (beyond the 30 min free time) at Rs. 999/- per day.

Ok they don't have as many activities as Udaipur but enough to keep your young ones entertained for a couple of days. Highlight is the food, there are very few hotels who would offer best taste in dishes of all cuisines and Ceceil chefs beat ITC Rajputana (my personal favourite on food).

Thanks Mehul, chef bhatia, Jigyasa, I could go on... for making it a wonderful experience.  The hotel is tucked away from the main mall area which is actually great to have some quiet walks in the morning. Rooms have a wonderful view. Pool is well maintained and other activities offered are a delight.  The hotel doesn't go overboard with the buffet spread but sticks to relevance... Food quality is good.",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Part of a Great Rail Journeys tour we thought this hotel was to be the highlight. It was very good but the food was not quite 4 star. A bit lacking in variety with the buffet not very warm.

"After travelling some 10 hours by train and Toy Train the sight of the Cecil Hotel was much welcomed. The first room we were shown was overlooking a busy road with several cars parked near by. We wanted peace and quiet and requested a change in room. This was quickly attended to, the room being at the rear of the building with partial views of the distant mountains. Regrettably, the room also proved very cold especially the bathroom. An engineer was called but it took him his second visit on the second day to identify the problem with the air conditioning. The room temperature was improved but the bathroom remained chilly throughout our stay. Each time we went to the restaurant we were asked whether we were part of a group, despite saying we were individual travellers the same‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"The moment you step in, you can see the vintage in every detail and yet feel the luxury that you can expect here. Very well maintained where heritage is not compromised to provide modern-day luxury to the visitors.  Coming to the service, there is no surprise and one can enjoy the oberoi standard of service. The whole team was very welcoming, helpful and ready to serve the needs of the guests. We were travelling with our 2-year old daughter, and they had kept chocalates with her name written in our room, which just delighted our darling. Such small thoughts is what take the service to next level of delight.  On the food, it was good and we enjoyed most of our meals. It was my 40th birthday and my wife requested for a custom cake to be made (it was a surprise for me), and after‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Cecil Oberoi in the centre of Shimla lives up to its 5 star status. Very comfortable rooms. There is an extra charge for rooms with a good view. Food was average, the staff are very polite and helpful. The location is excellent to view all the points of interest nearby by walking, as parking could pose a problem. Wifi access is limited to 30 minutes free each day, for faster internet and more time there is a fee.",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
We arrived at the Oberoi Cecil after a very long day of travel. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and the hot chocolate was gratefully received.  The room was spacious and very comfortable and the lounge area a wonderful place to unwind and a have drink before dinner. There was good variety of food available in the restaurant and everything we tried was delicious. The staff were extremely courteous and made our stay wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"The hotel has everything you want...history, location, luxury, facilities. Rooms are good size (we stayed in premium valley view) and extremely comfortable. Bathrooms modern. Central atrium lounge fabulous for drinks...worth going for a look if you are not staying.  Location is just above the railway station so it is well located and quick to get to off the toy train!   Food was good...as was the wine!   Staff were genuinely very friendly and helpful - this makes a real difference when it's meant.  My point about groups...clearly lots of holiday groups go to shimla and many stay here. Not a problem...in fact good for the groups and the Cecil.

After a 5 hour journey on the toy train, the hot chocolate that greeted us was very welcome! The check in process is effortless and quick and done with the upmost efficiency. The rooms are lovely and we were lucky enough to have a mountain view. The food in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast were both superb as was the service. The bar area has very comfortable seating and is a place where you can happily wile away an hour or 2 whilst the barman serves you wonderful cocktails. The only slight downside was the fact that a large convention of people were also staying.

Because it was our wedding anniversary a few extra touches were added by the staff, even balloons in our room!

This hotel was the very best we stayed in.  We were upgraded to a suite with wonderful views across the Himalayas.  The pool was a good size.  The food in the restaurant was very good indeed and it was not as expensive as you might expect for a 5* hotel.  The service was perfect in every way from reception through to the restaurant.  The policy of no tipping individuals was a welcome relief and the concept of leaving an overall tip at reception on departure was a good one.,Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Walk in and the greeting is warm and professional and then you pass in to the lounge/bar area set in a large atrium the full five floors high and with balconies all around each level. The whole ambiance is one of tradition and class with large rooms and bathrooms, many with superb views of the mountains. The restaurant serves very good food accompanied by the highest level of service. The spa and pool is lovely with my wife enjoying a much needed massage to restore her stamina. Downsides? Only one really. The weather was good but quite cool and the aircon seemed incapable of delivering any heat. A genuine five star hotel that lived up to our previous experience of Oberoi group.

"After a week of wedding celebrations in the August heat of Delhi, the retreat to the cooler climate of Shimla was a welcome respite. We were met by an Oberoi chauffeur at the Station after travelling up by the Shivalik narrow gage train. From the first sip of our welcome drinks and the friendly smiles we knew we were in for a real treat. The Hotel itself exudes the charm of a previous age. The luxury suite exceeded our high expectations; the views over the cedar filled valley were breath taking. Our children were spoiled by all the Hotel staff; our son was presented with a delicious cake for his first year Birthday and both children were given toys and traditional costumes.

"We stayed for 4 nights and could not fault anything at this hotel. There are plenty of 5 star hotels offering great service but I have never come across such a personal and human staff.  The food was excellent and the staff were very happy to suggest dishes they thought we would like and often adapted dishes for us.  The swimming pool is a proper pool not just a splash pool, treat yourself to a spa treatment during your stay.  Every day the management staff stopped and had a chat with us, not necessarily about the service but life in general. So refreshing not to just have the 'corporate chat' that is so often a feature of these hotels.

Monkeys were climbing around and sat on our balcony. You have to be careful not to leave the door open or they will shoot in and steal the items from your fruit bowl! Breakfast was very good with a buffet and the staff served a cooked breakfast of your choice. Other meals and drinks were a bit expensive. The staff were fantastic, in keeping with a 5* hotel, and nothing was too much trouble. The toiletries provided in the bathroom were good quality.

Amazing position in Shimla.  Generally food ok except I got food poisoning after lamb burger.  Staff so helpful couldn't do enough for the guests.  Only one real complaint is that there is no continual wifi.  30 free minutes per day to be taken in one go is very limiting due to time difference.  Am amazed Oberoi are so mean.

Still have got fond memories. It was a family outing after a long time in the winter. It was a 4 day stay at The Oberoi Cecil and it was my first time with the Oberoi group. We visited on 24th jan as 28th Jan was my sisters b'day. The rooms were cozily done with a nice carpet area and the flooring was shiny. The bed was huge and puffy too. The view from the room was superb. Used to sit facing the window and enjoy a book or just gaze out sipping a hot cup of coffee. The food was nice but I thought it was a bit limited with not much choices. The staff was really courteous and know how to treat their guests. Every wish of us was fulfilled with no complaints.

It is hard to find enough superlatives to describe our truly wonderful stay at the Oberoi Cecil. Without doubt deserves its number 1 status.

My partner and I stayed for our anniversary.  The staff could do no more to make it utterly wonderful in evey aspect.  Jiggy met us upon our arrival and made us feel so welcome.  All the staff (Sanyog, Deepak, Ravi, Etc.) were great and even remembered what we liked to drink and even our preferences for coffee and how we took it.  We opted for private dining on our second evening (6 courses in all with 2004 Dom Perignon) served by Santog, truly magical.

It has been tastefully decorated to suit the period hotel feel. Don't get me wrong unlike other period hotels we have visited, the Oberoi Cecil has everything to make your stay relaxing and frustration free, down to everything working in our room, a huge change from past experiences in other hotels. The staff in this hotel clearly receive the best training in customer service and go out of their way to please.

As usual in India the staff were really keen to help in any way they could, and were particularly good to us. My wife and I were travelling together - and always prefer twin beds - culturally in India this is unusual - and the staff do not always understand this. In this hotel all the best rooms all have double beds, After some negotiation we were provided with a single bed in addition to and just as comfortable as the giant existing bed.

"Have just returned from a stay in the Oberoi Cecil in Shimla as part of a tour around India's Golden Triangle with GRJ Where do I start? The hotel is fabulous with excellent rooms and views over Shimla and the foothills of the Himalayas. The restaurant serves wonderful food and the chef appeared each night to ask if the food was satisfactory. I think he genuinely wanted the guests to enjoy his food.  The swimming pool was heated and like getting into a warm bath, very enjoyable after a days sightseeing. However what really makes this hotel special are the staff. All the staff were cheerful, helpful and friendly. I am unable to praise them enough. Each and every one of them is a credit to the hotel.",Date of stay: January 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We stayed here for two nights after moving from another hotel (Woodville Palace) which had been so cold and dark. I had tried to book online first thing in the morning but had a bit of a problem which I think was more to do with the slow wifi at the grotty hotel. Anyway the manager of the Cecil actually rang the next morning and said not to worry and he would sort everything out - which he did. We arrived for an early check in and were given a lovely welcome and a hot chocolate. We has room 412 which was lovely for us and felt like a sanctuary. Unfortunately I was not well for some of the time we were in Shimla and developed a chest infection. The staff were kindness itself, offering to go to the chemists and sending up pots of special spiced tea (called 'grog') that might help‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We stayed here as part of a tour.  Perched high on the hill it has amazing views. The bedrooms are roomy and have every thing you might want but the bathrooms are very cold and a bit dated the bath is small and you can't lie out in it, and the shower is in the bath.  The swimming pool is wonderful. Best part of the hotel usually not busy and the water is really really warm. If you use it go down in your costumes and the dressing gown as there is only a small screen communal changing area.  The food....we'll you wouldn't go there for the food. They will, cook you eggs etc for breakfast if you ask but the evening meals are almost entirely vegetarian.  Not the best meals I have had in India.

He made everything available for us no matter what our choice of food were. Be was it lauki ki sabzi or flavor of kulcha-chana or all Indian sweets of different kind which we could think of. Staff at restaurant was also good and I like to thank Nandini who always served the food with a big smile. The spread of buffet breakfast is very good. The staff is truly amazing.

Drinks were served by ur team member in glasses at 2.18am also do u have liquor license to serve so late and generate bills  2. Security was just standing and nothing was done on there part to request guest to behave.  3.

A great welcome at this hotel maybe with people not quite out of the spirit of Diwali or maybe with it being wedding season in India. The friendliness of staff persisted throughout our stay.  The rooms were spacious and clean and opened onto one of the galleries that 'circumnavigated' the hotel which forms a large atrium. Our room was on the third floor looking down into the main lounge and bar area.  The dining room was one floor below ground level but lifts were an option to those disinclined to use the wide staircases.

"Although described as a five star hotel, being in India I had no idea what to expect. It does not have an imposing fa√ßade nor does it sit in beautifully manicured gardens but this is because all of Shimla sits on steep hillsides, with the exception of the Viceroys Palace. Nestled high on the hills of Shimla we had a very well equipped room with stunning views across the valley. It is not a large hotel so it had an air of intimacy and personality that some larger hotels lack.

We were going to have breakfast on the balcony. but were advised against it because of the monkeys, we thought this may have been a bit cautious, as we were on the top floor, but after seeing the monkeys later, there is no way I would want to come face to face with one or two (or a whole family) on my balcony. Just a word of warning, if you have kids, please practice some common sense, do not let them run towards the monkey, they are wild and will view a child running towards them as a threat.

The restaurant is fabulous too, we had the buffet and √† la carte and both were excellent. The chefs will even vary the dishes being offered as part of the buffet on request! Didn't use the spa but did use the great indoor pool, which is a really good size. Try to get a mountain view room, you won't be disappointed. Another tip, never, ever leave your bedroom window open when you're not in the room, the monkeys will soon move in in your absence! Easy recommendation.",Date of stay: November 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"We had a lovely, large well appointed room with dressing room and en suite.  We took the buffet which was extremely good and well priced.  Again as in many of the 5* hotels we stayed in on this trip the staff were very attentive and when I complained about having to pay for wifi in 5* hotel, they waived the charge.  Good pool and gym that has a Pilates reformer.",Date of stay: November 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"When we were shown to our room my wife wanted to cry with delight, such was the quality of the room and the breathtaking view from the balcony. It was truly stunning, looking south through the intersecting, misty valleys, the sun from sunrise to sunset, and Kites and Golden Eagles circling and rising on the therms.   I really can't say anything negative about this hotel; to us, our stay was as perfect as it could be. The fabulous lobby, breakfast and dinner meals and wonderful hotel staff.  The hotel is about 25 minutes easy walk from the Mall, and overlooks the train station, and world heritage narrow-gauge Toy Train.",Date of stay: November 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"There are some tiny cracks in this hotel‚Äôs near perfect fa√ßade: the lifts may not go from the floor you‚Äôre on to the floor you want to be on, so there‚Äôs a lot of up-and-downstairs; the hotel is also some way from the centre of town, and surprisingly does not offer a shuttle service.  But once we‚Äôd come to terms with these very minor irritations, we had nothing but admiration for the qualities of the place. Service was impeccable, instant, attentive and mind-reading (you don‚Äôt dare hesitate when approaching a staircase lest people appear from nowhere and carry you!). Maybe it verged on the obsequious.

Several members of staff just bent over backwards to be helpful to us. The food in the restaurant was superb, and the selection was fantastic. If you wanted anything making fresh, they would do it within minutes. Our room and bathroom were large and very comfortable - we really wanted for nothing.

Stayed here for three nights and this is a genuine five star hotel (with drinks prices to match). Internet is also chargeable which I find really mean when paying premium hotel rates. The food and service were high class which I could not fault. Rooms were to a high specification. The hotel is a ten - fifteen minute pleasant walk to the town centre and main shopping area.

Our stay at the Cecil was our second and we were not disappointed with the hotel. On arrival we were greeted by staff and taken to our room overlooking the valley. Though one of us was unwell the staff went out of their way to help at all times and make us comfortable. The food was mire varied than before we were really spoilt for choice.   Spent some time in the pool area. Very few guests were using it at this period of the year. Was a pity that the jacuzzi was not operational.   Overall it was a great few days - the walk at a leisurely pace to the centre took us about 25 minutes but there were viewpoints all along the way.

The room (we were luck) was huge and very well decorated (not at all tired), the spa facilities, food and location were all very good, but what really stood out was the service. The staff in the restaurant were friendly and very attentive. For those who did not want curry, there was no menu, they had only to ask for what they wanted (i.e. someon on our table wanted plain chicken and she was given two chicken breasts).

This hotel is outside the main stretch of Shimla itself but has an amazing atrium lounge area and the rooms were spacious and full of atmosphere.

The waiters are so helpful and the waiting lounge is super awesome introducing you to the high and colonial style hotel. You don't have to stand at the reception as your check in details are sorted out while you having the welcoming drink. Never got to experience the steam room but the pool was amazing. Apparently the only hotel in Shimla with an indoor heated pool - as per the service lady. The room was okay for me and the service throughout the one night stay i can say was really nice.

The ambiance of the place is something special, the atrium/bar area, and especially the food and service in the restaurant are well worth a trip to Shimla. A special mention to Krishna and Shoumi (who seemed to run the entire restaurant 24 hours a day). Both were outstandingly professional and knowledgeable - Thank you.

The service is good - maybe not quite as good as the Ranthmanbore Oberoi we stayed at but still exceptional. If I was being critical the hotel suffers from having too many large coach parties staying on quick turnover which does mean their normal outstanding service levels suffer occasional.

"Stayed at the Oberoi Cecil for 2 nights as part of an Indian Tour with Kuoni. This was the best hotel we stayed at during the tour. Check in was smooth and efficient, our room was very spacious and very clean. We used the pool which was lovely and a lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of our tour. Food was excellent for breakfast and dinner, all the staff in the restaurant were extremely attentive and explained all the dishes to us which was very helpful. All staff in all areas gave wonderful service, but special thanks to Mr.Tenzing Tashi for his services in the restaurant.

I have only one word to express my feeling about Oberoi luxury chain of hotels  that is unbelievable super Hospitality. Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. During the stay my daughter in law and grand daughter fell sick. The way staff of the hotel handle and care both of them is beyond imagination  I think our own relatives also would have not taken the care the way hotel staff did.  The chef used to come to room specially to know if we need something extra or special  and they used to bring.  We have stayed Raj vilasJaipur few months ago. Same treatment we experienced  . My whole family express the best wishes to all staff and management of Oberoi group.,Date of stay: October 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

My only complaint was that (just like all the other hotels I stayed at in India) the bar did not stock slimline tonic to go with the gin.

We stayed here in the first week of October just for a weekend and came back very happy with the hospitality yet again from an Oberoi property.

Infact she was gifted a cute teddy by the hotel staff !  The  breakfast buffet was sumptuous and everything was delicious.

This exposes it to each and every check in and check out activities of guests or any time they leave or approach their room, noises made by kids running around and daily chores of cleaning staff which I expect to be hidden in background while I'm dining in a heritage hotel make it a very noisy place.

"We stayed as part of a Jules Verne tour.   This is a very special hotel in a great town.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed although the views can be a little disappointing.  Our view was over the metal roof to the houses and views beyond.    The food in the restaurant is exceptional and the service very good.  Staff are friendly and helpful. The spa, pool and treatments are very good and not overly expensive. Again, the staff here are very helpful and attentive.  I would have given a 5 rating but, yet again, having to pay for wifi after 30 minute use in this day and age is unacceptable. The wifi was slow and I really do object to paying for it.

When I have already informed both the Hotel Staff/Reservation Team about my journey, surely, while checking my booking details in the morning, today, this point could have been informed to me or taken up in a more discrete manner.

Living in the UK as I do, their continental spread was a little lacking. But good effort, nevertheless. The Indian spread was faultless. This being my first time in the North, I can only assume the local and other north Indian food were of authentic taste. The south Indian fare (I am south Indian), was very good and very much authentic. The staff were also very helpful in making recommendations.

As per the name the property stood higher than the standards my family was expecting. 3 nights stay seemed short by the end of our trip.

Special mention of Akshay,Manoj and Kunjan, who were most humble and welcoming.

The rooms have luxurious toiletries by forest essentials, and our suite had a large sitting area where all of us would often hang out together, when not using the spa, the activity center or the spacious lobby.

3 nights here and it proved to be my favourite hotel in India. I wasn't sure what to expect from an Indian 5*' but it genuinely is an international 5*. It has so much character and has been very well looked after. Every member of staff was so polite and helpful. The bedroom was large and very comfortable with a lovely bathroom with endless hot water. The indoor pool was like bathwater when the temperature outside was dropping. The restaurant food gave a good selection of very well produced Indian and Western food - the omelettes at breakfast were to die for!! Half an hours free wifi per day was plenty. A great position for the main sites of Shimla with great views over the valley. I can't praise this place enough.,Date of stay: April 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

From the moment you arrive at the hotel till the moment you leave you will find that the staff just cannot do enough for you. As for the hotel itself with all the wood paneling and the lovely rooms it is difficult to find fault. We stayed as part of a large family group and were amazed that the head chef (Raj)  took time to introduce himself and find out if there was anything we would like to eat (not on the menu)  Tashi -Food and beverage manager was amazing and took it upon himself to organize mountain biking for us when we asked him what there was to do (an easy ride but great scenery) Also worth a mention is Shanu and Kungan both of whom provided excellent service.

"We have just returned from a two week holiday in India, a country that my wife and I had long wanted to visit, a holiday we shared with another couple. We stayed 3 nights at the Oberoi where we were very well looked after. During our last day, unfortunately a trip further into the foothills of the Himalayas had to be cancelled owing to the weather.  However, the gracious service by all the staff at our hotel helped to mitigate our disappointment. The staff in the lounge and in the restaurant in particular could not do enough for us. They were attentive and courteous almost to a fault. When I commented to chef that the food perhaps could do with s bit more spice the next two nights he provided us with dishes that were very tasty and enjoyable.

"Really like this place.  It has a colonial feel about it and the majority of the guests were European which only adds to that feel.  You can feel the history of the place.  We were given a nice room in the corner which was everything you would expect a 5 star hotel to provide.  We were warned not to leave the windows open as apparently the Monkeys get in and they know where the mini bar is!! Bar staff were very good and always checked back to make sure the drinks were to our liking.  Food in the restaurant was excellent as was the breakfast which, although it was a buffet, the staff were happy to bring things to the table.  We did use the indoor pool which was OK.

"The Oberoi Cecil in Shimla has staff that really do try to help with a smile. The hotel is 130 years old with a very British history attached to it, newly refurbished it offers tourists a great base for the Mall and as a respite from the travel on the toy train, the rooms are large and airy but beware and turn the heating down to 21c.  All tips are paid into a central box, this is quit strictly observed as when our luggage was delivered and a tip offered he asked for it to be put into the central system which they all share.

Through our own fault we didn't have a room with a balcony, this is the only improvement I can think of.....unless I missed it, there is no outside space to sit and enjoy the mountain air.

However, the pool was a delight, as was the restaurant. The buffet was fresh and interesting, with food for all tastes and the staff were, without exception, charming. The location was excellent - not far to the sights of this fascinating little town and it felt very safe to walk around. We can highly recommend both this and the nearby Oberoi hotel Wildflower Hall - the Cecil for the ease of getting into Shimla and Wildflower for the peace and tranquillity afforded by being out of the town and nearer the Himalayas.

The restaurant served a la carte or buffet both of which were very tasty. The restaurant staff can't do enough for you.  It is worth booking a table as they can be full and you have to wait for a vacant table. The ambience of the hotel was relaxed and had an air of elegance. The indoor pool is heated and you can use the steam room in the spa area.

I have been on training courses where the exemplar team is described whereby every member of the team knows exactly what he or she has to do - and they do it in an outstanding manner: well, this is that very team!  What I like most is the discreet manner in which a guest's every need is accommodated with a smile and good nature.  The management of this hotel, if they haven't already, should win an award for outstanding customer service.

The hotel is absolutely immaculate and the staff provided us with the best service I have ever experienced - nothing was too much trouble and every need was taken care of.   A nice touch and is that individual tipping is not encouraged and you can leave a gratuity at the end of your stay if you please, which I presume is shared around to everyone.  So you are not getting service with the expectation of a tip, and this somehow makes it even better.

We'd booked 'breakfast, lunch & dinner' package, so spent a lot of time in the restaurant, and we got to know many of the staff well. We certainly enjoyed exploring the flavours of India with them. Their knowledge and genuine enthusiasm made for a wonderful experience. Nothing was too much trouble. Service was attentive, but not over the top. The chef even typed up his recipe for our favourite dish ! Our sunny south facing room had a wide view over the Shimla Valley, and was very spacious. We swam in the (29 degree) pool daily, and enjoyed excellent massages on our final day. And, our Wedding‚Ä¶",Date of stay: January 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"This is an excellent hotel with charming staff, comfortable rooms and a great location at the far end of the famous Mall. We stayed here for three nights in late December, where the weather was cold but sunny. The restaurant buffet was very good for breakfast and dinner, but it is worth ordering fresh from the menu even if you have meals included. The bar was friendly but a bit cold as it is the centrepiece of a tall atrium. The spa treatments were superb and very good value by Western standards. Rooms were very comfortable with a traditional colonial feel. Wifi is only free for the first 30 minutes, something they should change. Unusually for India, tips are banned and you are encouraged to leave a tip for all staff in a reception box when you leave instead.

The food prepared by chef was the highlight of our stay. Location wise also it is easily accessible to key tourist sights. Booking cabs for sight seeing was done quickly. We were impressed by these people within the staff - Shivani, Chef Rajkumar Bhatia, Shanu, Ankit, and trainees (some names we are forgetting but they made a huge impression with their high service standardS too).

"Although a little worn around the edges this only adds to the overall impression of staying in a grand hotel from a bygone age. The staff are attentive and friendly without being in your face. The decor and furniture fit perfectly into the overall theme of understated luxury. The breakfast alone is worth a visit, probably the best i've had in India. The spa treatments are also first rate. A couple of minor quibbles stopped me from marking it excellent, the lunch in the lobby lounge was on the cold side with small portions and the spa was not as quiet as it could be due to the noise from the road. That being said I would not hesitate to return to this charming, well run and perfectly positioned gem.",Date of stay: January 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"THE OBEROI CECIL IS A VERY GOOD HOTEL. AS THEY SAY, WHAT MATTERS IN A HOTEL IS HOW THE PERSON HANDING YOU OVER THE KEY BEHAVES, HOW THE PERSON TAKING YOUR LUGGAGE TO THE ROOM BEHAVES etc.  I certainly will rate the hotel 10 on 10 in all the aspects. A must visit. The staff is so good and so cordial. They do not perform their duty. They show their culture. I was assisted by a trainee namely Ms Nandini and my family still talks about how  good she was to us.

It is walking distance to the town centre and has remarkable views of the hills around. The broadband connection was super fast from the hotel computer in the lobby.  The hotel is newly decorated in an old fashioned style with highly polished hard wood floors in the bedroom and luxurious furniture throughout.  It is an expensive super luxe hotel and because of that I will record two areas which I felt let the hotel down.

We arrived at the Cecil after a long journey by train from Delhi and had an excellent 3 night stay as part of a tour of Northern India. Our room was good and readily changed from the one we initially were allocated on arrival so we had a better view. The bar and restaurant were extremely good - I remember the Himalayan lamb in buttermilk yogurt - delicious! And the service could not be faulted. When we were about to depart I realised that my shirts were all packed in the main luggage that had been sent on ahead! What to do? The staff could not have been more helpful and within 15 minutes a shirt had been obtained from the market for me - resolving the problem.

I purchased Deluxe Room which cost me around 14000 (inclusive tax) for 2 people. I got a corner room with valley view it was just splendid view.

The atrium is stunning, but it is a bit of an echo chamber.  We had a ground floor room near the bar and found it very noisy outside in the early evening.  One evening a party of people were drinking until nearly midnight and the noise was loud enough to stop us getting to sleep.  I called the concierge to ask if the drinkers could be asked to be quieter but nothing changed - I suspect they weren't even asked. Also, noise from outside the hotel (dogs barking at dawn, car radios in the early hours) was a problem - albeit less so than the noise from the bar.",Date of stay: November 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The food served was well above expectations and the staff were all warm and friendly. On my wife's birthday the hotel provided a birthday cake ( without asking) as well as a staff rendition of "" happy birthday"" which was a real treat and so unexpected.",Date of stay: November 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"The Cecil is a perfect combination of old world charm and modern comfort. The property is beautiful and maintained to Oberoi's exacting standards.  Rooms are large and well ventilated and bathrooms are well appointed. The indoor swimming pool, heated to 29 degrees C, is a perfect way to start the day. The Grecian Bath type enclosure is also heated so you don't freeze when you exit the pool! The Gym is also well equipped and between the pool and the gym and walks we managed to keep our weight in place.  The bar/lounge at the lobby level is delightful and Mr Narayan, the pianist delights with old western and hindi numbers every evening. Perfect pre dinner time pass.

"Shimla  itself is an intriguing place . Whilst any buildings are in need of some tender care , it feels clean and fresh and the streets are teeming with friendly smiling people . We attend at the oberoi as part of a trip with great railway journeys . From the initial greeting of welcome drink and bindi , the staff calmly exude a professionalism and service that will set your stay apart from other hotels . Within the back drop if a stunningly refurbished colonial building , rooms are beautifully presented and evening staff will check your every need and turn down your bed . The buffet meals cater for every taste , but if you need something extra the chef and waiter are happy to please .

We had a superbly spacious room in this luxury hotel. Unfortunately the resident on the floor above left a tap running (no overflows - a design flaw) that subsequently soaked our luggage. It was like a scene from Titanic with water dripping from the ceiling and running down the wood paneling. The staff were endlessly apologetic and arranged a team of people to move us to another room (even more spacious but lacking the far-reaching view of the first room). They took the sopping case to be dried out and the wet clothing to be laundered. As we had reduced appetites at this stage of our holiday we opted for the a la carte menu. In retrospect this was a mistake and we should have picked at the Indian buffet. Our meal was disappointing.

The rooms are luxurious and comfortable and filled with a touch of the past. Food was good and the distance from the market was a pleasant short walk. We have stayed at many Oberoi hotels in the last few years but this one was our favourite. The pool was the best part.

Only disadvantage being that this hotel has no lawns so you're pretty much in your room to enjoy the beauty. Not complaining coz it has a gorgeous lobby and gorgeously appointed rooms.  F&B was average...not upto the Oberois mark. But not complaining ....everything else was perfect. Kids had a blast in what they call tej best activity centre they've ever been to. Full marks to that...couples with a heated pool.   The walk to the mall is long but you have the option of a drop to the lift so itv works out fine. We enjoyed the walk so not complaining at all.

"If they say God is in the details then surely Oberoi is a temple. You get a small print out of tomorrow's weather forecast placed on your bedside every evening. That is an example of the lengths that this hotel goes through to make your stay exceptional. I've stayed in many different kind of hotels but not one of them made me feel this good about parting with my money.   This was my first ever stay in an Oberoi property and i have nothing but severe compliments to give to the Hotel's amazing staff. I booked two Premier valley view rooms to celebrate my birthday in Shimla. When i got to the hotel, every member of the staff from the general manager to the guards at the door wished me a happy birthday.

The Oberoi hotels are a class apart and the Cecil is no less. An excellent hotel with great service and style. The staff is very hospitable and warm. The rooms are really big and grand. The toilets are superb with nice toiletries.  A highly recommendable place to stay but if you want to spend for the comfort and grandeur. The breakfast in the morning is excellent. The atrium bar is well stocked and one can sit here in the evenings and down a couple of drinks.,Date of stay: November 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Cecil is a classic hotel which is situated right at the entrance of Shimla. Brilliant hospitality shown by the hotel GM and his excellent staff. The hotel has a great breakfast buffet spread with brilliant service provided by the staff. The hotel sometimes has access issues as its  situated next to the Vidhan Sabha.  The rooms are clean and i simply loved the bed and the pillows. A must try is their spa service. Also it has a lovely indoor pool. A great hotel to spend a holiday. Although, it doesn't have a proper pub, it does have an English style bar.

"Where do you start - Oberoi Cecil  - perfection!  Went to Shimla for three days down time after a fast paced trip through the Golden Triangle and immediately travelled back in time to a world of old fashioned colonial service where ones every need was anticipated and catered for - like being carefully wrapped in a cashmere blanket! Well located with stunning views - the bedrooms were well appointed - the public areas, the amazing atrium, the dining room, the pool area, the spa - just wonderful.  The staff were ever present but never intrusive - the waiting staff in the bar and dining room, the room services - a credit to their training.  As a non-swimmer I was just happy to sit in the pool area reading a book and looking at the fantastic view - an afternoon spent having‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"When I booked us at the Oberoi Cecil, I wasn't too sure about what to expect. When we checked in, I was pleasantly surprised to find a spacious room with an outstanding view. We had expected the room to be smaller considering the hotel is located in the heart of Simla, hence the room definitely exceeded expectations.  The chefs were both responsive when it came to ordering for my 3 year old's meals. The personally ensured that the food was customized as per our instructions.  When we stepped out for a walk, we were yet again elated with the location of the property as we realized that its located in the VIP zone thus making it less cluttered n polluted as compared to the rest of Simla.

"Cecil. A sneak preview of historical extravagance and an opportunity to sample the Colonial era. The property is located very close to the Vidhan sabha and the Observatory and is not crowded. The mall is walking distance and the sunrise from east facing rooms is magnificent. At the hotel one must try the Spa & swimming pool both reminiscence of the era gone by.  Arriving at the hotel is a breeze, staff is extremely courteous and would move a hill for you (pun intended), the oodles of charm in the hotel just does not end. From the wooden staircase, green marbled bathrooms, the library, atrium. I think i just could not have enough. Practical advises -  1. Give a day just to explore and enjoy the hotel.

"We stayed there as a family in September 2010. It was a great experience. The staff was extremely courteous. They took great care of us - pickup from Chandigrah, driver to Shimla - worked like a charm. When we went to the Mall, my mother, who could not walk much was put up in the Clarke's (the sister Oberoi hotel) tea room. The food, though a bit bland, was good. They even made Khichdi for us when it rained. We could not have had a more pleasant experience. Walking around was really nice, as was taking a car to go to Naldera et al. Really enjoyed the stay.

"The property is like any other five star property, nicely done, decent rooms (though could have been larger given its not a urban city hotel but a vacation/hill station hotel) but what sets them apart is the service.

"""There is no hospitality like understanding"" a phrase by Vanna Bonta and staff at Oberoi Cecil proved it perfectly. We stayed there with our 3 years old daughter for 3 nights and we have no words to appreciate the hospitality we had been offered. From the manager to the chauffeur all were so good in understanding our demands and needs that we would really love to come again soon. Our kid enjoyed to the max in their activity centre which was full of toys, games and even activities for the adults. The food was amazing and specially the service we got in their restaurant was fantastic, like if we don't like something in their buffet, they were ready to make anything from their menu inclusive in the buffet.

"This property imbibes the values of hospitality right from the book. Staff is good and helpful, always eager to exceed expectations. During breakfast, we found the shake was not as cold as we wanted, so we asked for ice. The steward suggested that it would not taste good with ice and offered to change it with a fresh one and much more colder. I was impressed. Rooms are very good, tolieteries the very best you can expect. But location is a bit issue as you may have to walk for about 30 minutes to reach the Mall by foot.  It must have been my 11th visit to Shimla, but this time we decided to to visit Viceregal Lodge ( the hotel offered courtesy drop and pick-up)- worth visiting, we were also delighted to visit Gaitey Theatre at the Mall Road adjoining Shimla Corporation building.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The hotel is located at the very edge of the town and has a slight problem with noise from the traffic and other residents.This one negative comment is due to children running around the floors, playing on the landings and generally treating the hotel as a nursery, as well as family having a reunion party up till 2.00 a.m. until a complaint was lodged.

The view from the hotel room that we stayed was stunning- with morning mist and noon raining made it look like we were stationed on the clouds and simply flying off in space- The valley view and the tiny home on the mountain slopes, walk through the zig zag roads among the mountains took its toll on our breathing speed, but the fresh air made us feel so fresh within. Amazing location of our hotel made it all possible to simply access every corner by view, and also walk through to the bazaar not more than 2 km.

"We had a wonderful 3 day stay at Shimla at Cecil. Our original choice was wildflower hall and then we found out that children below 10 are not allowed in that hotel. It was just as well because it is quite some distance out from shimla as we later found out. Cecil on the other hand is a dream for kids and about a 10-15 minutes walk away from the mall. It has a large heated pool, a surprisingly large and very well equipped activity centre with a doll house, slide, table games like carom, pool table, even video games and of course art and craft.

Room service was good (particularly the biriyani) and the vegetarian thali in the restaurant was plentiful and delicious.. We found breakfasts a little changeable though: one day it was good but on the second day some of the pastries tasted a little stale and the 'hot' food was only luke warm.

When you walk into the Oberoi Cecil you know that the visit will be memorable.  The rooms are on several floors around an atrium. You look down to the bar and lounge. The rooms are large and well appointed.  The restaurant serves both buffet style and a la carte meals. The service is impeccable.  The onlt problem we found was that our room was quite cold in the evening - the transition from winter heating to summer cooling. However when under the bedclothes all was warm.

I struggled to understand how adults and children could throw waste food and packaging out of the train window into the beautiful Himalayas! I was relieved that the Oberoi is not in the centre of Shimla (as Shimla too was very littered) the hotel has its own grounds about 30 mins drive from the station. There are several walks you can do from the hotel. We did 3 of the walks. The hotel will pack a picnic for guests, in a ruck sack with a blanket. The food was delicious.

"As the conclusion of Riviera Travel‚Äôs ‚ÄòShimla extension‚Äô tour of northern India my wife and I stayed at the Oberoi Cecil for three days in early April 2014.  Shimla ‚Äì and this hotel ‚Äì were the highlight of this fabulous tour for us, and if I were to compare the Cecil to any other hotel in our experience it would be London‚Äôs Savoy of the early 1990‚Äôs (before the Savoy was ‚Äòmodernised‚Äô, or ‚Äì some would say ‚Äì ‚Äòmucked up‚Äô).  That is not to say that the Cecil is not modern, for it is, perfectly, but as a former hill-station of the Raj it retains that style, that elegance and the attention to period detail which make it special and extraordinary, a jewel set in the breath-taking scenery of the Himalayan foothills.

"We stayed here for 3 days and wished it could have been more. The staff in this hotel were the best I have experienced anywhere, so friendly, so helpful, a tribute to the management.. We were in a tour group and found that the buffet food was at least as good as the a la carte options.The hotel and the rooms were quaint and old worldly but as comfortable as you could wish for. All the positive reviews I have read about this hotel are true but even better. My wife sampled the spa treatments and said the treatments and staff were on a par with the rest of the hotel. A true taste of luxury. My only suggestion would be that daily internet fees of ¬£10 a day are a bit high. I hope I can return some day.

Watching the thunderstorm run round the mountains and then having a 6:00a.m. alarm call from a monkey trying the balcony doors are priceless experiences. Staff were very attentive and friendly although checkout could be more businesslike. Food in restaurant is awesome, pricey but worth it. Breakfast good even with large groups in. However if you want food when the restaurant is shut go elsewhere. Lounge food is very european, over priced and disappointing.

The valley facing room we had was very large and beautifully furnished including king size bed, sofa and seating area, writing desk as well as a view to die for.  We enjoyed the restaurant, dining off the A La-Carte rather than the buffet. The bill including drinks coming to around ¬£35-¬£40, expensive by Indian standards but value for money. If you can, get a window table with a view over the valley, although it may get a bit cool as the windows do let in a bit of a draught (despite being taped up ‚Äì looks better than it sounds).

The interior of the hotel is unlike anything I have seen, and kept spotlessly clean.. Bedrooms were spacious with everything you could need and lovely comfortable beds.

The hotel was really nice and well placed to do whatever you wished in Shimla by foot or by taxi.  The exterior woodwork could do with a spot of paint however.  The staff were fantastic and eager to help and please the guests.  An example is that when we arrived there was a cake in our room as it was my 60th birthday.  There was a slight mix up as the cake was mixed up with another couple who were celebrating their Golden Wedding - but it tasted nice anyway.  Staff often helped the less able guests by carrying their food back to the table.  The food was exceptional - it might seem a simple thing but the naan bread was consistently head and shoulders above anywhere else we stayed in India.  The gym was small but adequate.

Ideally situated this hotel was wonderful with excellent staff who were anxious to please.  Food was really good and the rooms are comfortable with really nice complementary toiletries .  I treated myself to a massage at the spa and another felt like I was floating on air when I came out.  It really did give the feeling of being transported to a bygone age with all the modern comforts.  If I am really picky there are only 2 faults - the indoor pool was a little warm for my liking and there is no outdoor space but this is because of the problem with the monkeys.,Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Our second Oberoi experience was just like the first in Delhi.  This hotel was built like a country house and full of character.  Our room was palatial with lovely oriental rugs and heavy curtains to keep out the cold.  The view over the mountains when the sun came up was lovely. The service was again top notch and nothing too much trouble for any of the staff.  We were impressed with how knowledgeable they were and how anxious to please.  The food was absolutely delicious and a nice touch was that the Kitchen Executive was on hand at every meal enquiring whether everything was ok.  I have never seen such an outstanding buffet that they managed to put on at every meal.

"No doubt that after the Wild Flower Hotel, belonging to the Oberoi group, this is the best hotel in Shimla. And it is ""in"" Shimla form where the center can be reached on foot within 30 minutes. The staff, thoroughly trained to be accommodating make it a five star property, the rooms too. Very comfortable, although not too big, but they are a real home away from home. In my party somebody actually did get a monkey in the room ( it managed to open the window) and the food, which looks superb, tasted a little bland from time to time. However, they cooked wonderful breakfasts for me and the internet worked well. Some rooms are very public, on the ground floor surrounding the lobby bar area, although no noise can be heard.

The food is of high quality and well presented. Of particular note is the indoor pool, which affords great views and also a jacuzzi. Below that is the spa, which offers good massages at a reasonable price. Internet is provided free for 30 minutes a day...which is great for keeping track of e mails and messaging home.

"Shimla is at an altitude of around 1.5 miles, the service received at the Oberoi Cecil is of a similar high standard.  The hotel is imposing, from the large, open, atrium to the stunning views some of the rooms offer over the magnificent Shimla valley. What a place.  We stayed for only 3 nights, but it will live long in our memories.  We have stayed in many hotels, both for business and pleasure, but the Cecil tops them all for all round service.  Shimla itself is a remarkable place, and well worth the visit.  It's easy to see why the Viceroy built his lodge here.  But I doubt that he, or any of his guests, got better service than now available in the Cecil.

We were concerned that we would be kept awake by noise from the bar but happily we had uninterrupted sleep.  Unfortunately the weather was very variable with sun, rain, fog, hail and snow - the hotel heating did not seem to be quite up to keeping our room warm enough so the dressing gowns provided did duty as extra bedding!  The restaurant provided excellent quality and quantity of food with plenty of service available although the speed of service varied.  The swimming pool water was clean and warm as was the jacuzzi, very enjoyable apart from some noisy children in the pool.

Special mentions to Sachin, Ravindar, Krishna, and Chef Raj Kumar in the Restaurant and Tanzin and Dharma in the Bar. Chef Raj produced some spicier dishes for us on 2 nights of our 3 night stay and they were amazing.  Every member of staff we came in contact with was friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble, everyone appears to be very happy in their jobs and it comes accross in the service.

The service was impeccable throughout.  The restaurant was really good too with plenty of choice including buffet and al a carte options.  We used the heated indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi every day which was also really good - although you can't really see much of the Himalayas from the pool!

A kingsize bed awaits along with a beautiful bathroom. If I was to get really picky, it would have been nice to have had a separate shower. Even though my room was on the ground floor, because the hotel's built on the side of a hill (no climbs to get to it though as the road & path are at the same level), the view over the valley was spectacular.

"From the moment one arrives to a welcome mug of hot chocolate, to one's farewell, 'See you again', nothing is too much trouble.  Most of the rooms are around a central atrium where there is seating and a bar. The rooms are very well appointed, traditional style, with the Oberoi's divine pillows. (There is a supplement for the valley view.) The restaurant has a good value buffet dinner and √† la carte.  All staff are well trained, charming and almost over helpful.

The kids enjoyed the activity centre thoroughly (they have lots of stuff to do for kids of all ages) and all of us enjoyed the warm pool and Jacuzzi in the cold weather!! The room faced the valley and was beautiful and tastefully decorated.. the hotel has a nice old world british feel to it with all the wooden interiors and dark green carpeting etc.  The only area of improvement in the hotel would be the dinner - there wasn't enough variety in the buffet and the food was just average. Considering so many kids were staying in the hotel at the time, there should have been more kid friendly food in the buffet, and tastewise also the hotel could do better considering it is one of the best hotels in‚Ä¶",Date of stay: January 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Travelled to Shimla in Sept 2013 and stayed for 2 nights at Oberoi cecil. We truly loved this Oberoi Property. Location is extremely convenient. The staff was really friendly and helpful just like one expects Oberoi staff to be! The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The view from our room was lovely and the day we reached it rained and so we were happy to see the clouds entering our room ! We really enjoyed the beauty of Shimla from the resturant since it had some spectactular views while ofcourse having a lavish breakfast!  Sure to visit the hotel when next in Shimla.,Date of stay: September 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"My first visit to The Oberoi Cecil was in summer 2011 with my family and we've been here twice after that, and there's something about this hotel that keeps us coming back over and over again.  Going from Delhi to Shimla, this hotel is superbly located - it comes right at the entrance of Shimla and you don't have to go through the craziness of the town's traffic to get there. They also have a spacious parking at a lower level than the hotel, where we parked for the entire duration of our, and the hotel's car came to fetch us from there to take us to Cecil.  The rooms are cosy and comfortable. The suite is really spacious, and has a tiny balcony as well. The bathrooms are well appointed with Forest Essentials toiletries, and are nice overall, except for the lack of two essentials‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"I have taken this trip inspired by a Biography on M S Oberoi, the legendary Hotelier. I must have read it at least 6 months back and I have set my eyes on Shimla since then. Staying at Cecil was a good experience and I loved every minute of it. Spa was brilliant and the restaurant was with great service - though i had opted for In Room dining for my meals except breakfast. The rooms were of no great view as its facing the road below. They also have rooms facing the valley which will be great. A very hands on General Manager of the Hotel has provided with a book on the walking trails in Shimla and it was a source of great help for my Walk through the Mall area on the following day.

"The reputation of the cecil precedes it. It is thought by many to be the best hotel in Shimla. Well I can say by personal experience that this is not the case. For a hotel which set us back Rs.27000 for a two night stay, most things could have been a lot better.  To begin with the most important thing in any hotel - the rooms. They are small, really small but the bathrooms are smaller. An average sleeping experience with great but again overpriced food. However, it also has some plus points. The hotel is beautifully built and furnished with tasteful furniture and artwork. The food, as mentioned earlier, especially the breakfast is exceptional and the breakfast includes a plethora of cuisines. The pool and gym are also good. All in all, though I think you would be better off‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
One of the very best run and managed hotels I have ever visited. The staff are very well dressed and uniforms are provided by this hotel. Every one specks excellent English and your wish is their command. Guest comfort is their motto and they have staff meeting every day.

"This was our second stay at the Cecil, and once again we were amazed by the consistently high level of service demonstrated by the employees. From the top-notch group at the front desk to the attentive and friendly restaurant staff,  from the pleasant and responsive housekeeping crew  to the soothing ministrations of the spa masseuse, everything was as it should be in a world-class hotel. The attention to detail here is extraordinary, beginning with the welcoming hot chocolate at check-in and ending with the charming curbside farewell upon departure. In between, we received almost constant monitoring to make sure that all our needs were met.

"Our experience at the Oberoi Cecil was fantastic right from the start.  They picked us up at the train station and provided a baby seat for our 3 month old child.  Our room was big and spacious and they also provided a crib and moved it where we wanted it.  We were traveling with my father-in-law and we would have liked adjoining rooms which were not provided but our rooms were next to each other.  The service was excellent and the food/room service was fantastic.  The pool was the highlight though.  So beautiful!  The only other thing I would have changed was the view from our room, we got the street view and of course the mountainview would have been spectacular.",Date of stay: November 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"This was not really a five star property. You have a combination of stairs and lift all over the building. You can not reach your room by a single lift, take stairs then lift it is confusing.  The rooms are OK and the view just about satisfactory. It is away from the mall road for all practical purposes and they drop you to the lift again on paid charges. We stayed in their valley view room. The room service is good and food ordered in room is good. The food at the restaurant (buffet) is pathetic with hardly any variety or taste. If you have an option do not take package with breakfast included, it is not worth it.  Overall reasonable but would not definitely rate it excellent.",Date of stay: January 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

We had booked a nice top floor mountain view room and the room matched our expectations. The central heating in the hotel and room kept us warm throughout our stay despite the outside temperatures being sub-zero. Overall it's a nice heritage property. However, there were a few disappointments- They had organised a compulsory Gala dinner for NYE (Rs 4000 per person). We were surprised to see even soft drinks being charged separately. The DJ event wasn't what i was expecting. Even for a drop and pick-up to the mall road, the hotel charges you for it (distance is hardly 2 kms).

Further, the chef of the hotel also deserves a special mention as he customized his preparations to our tastes and earned our heartfelt compliemts.

Approach to the hotel: a little adventurous as the main approach road to the hotel is blocked for vehiclular traffic considering Himachal Vidhan Sabha building in vicinity. So you need to take alternate steep serpentine road to reach which could be risky. Check for complementary transfers from Railway Station at the time of booking.

Absolutely amazing hotel - would certainly be 6 stars if I could. The hotel is an amazing building architecturally.  Our room was massive and to an incredibly high standard.  Owing to its location on the hillside the swimming pool is inside and to a very high standard with 2 attendants at all times.  Cleanliness could not be faulted.  The staff very very friendly and efficient.  Newspapers were delivered in the morning as standard and even my postcards were sent by the hotel  (stamps not charged for).

Definitely the best hotel to stay in Shimla which is a magical place and a must to visit by 'Toy train' from Kalka.The only drawback to the hotel in my opinion is its lack of outside area---no gardens or anything ---but after all it is built on a hillside! Beware of the monkeys around the outside at the front---it is their territory and woe betide you if you are in their way.The rooms are very spacious and the cleanliness is superb and the swimming pool is a must to either start or end the day.The staff are courteous and helpful and breakfast was very good with good service.Take a step back in time and stay at this majestic hotel.,Date of stay: November 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Superbly located on the edge of Shimla's exotic town centre, within a short stroll of  The Mall, the main shopping street & centre of Shimla life, bought by Mr. Oberoi in 1932, to become the flagship hotel of his burgeoning group.  The winding, climbing 3 hour drive from the Ambala Cantonment rail station up to 2200 metres offers a panoply of interesting, & some astounding, views. And terrifying traffic!! The hotel was renovated in an ""old-fashioned"" style & re-opened in 1997. It reeks of a Raj ""Hill Station"" to which my grand-parents, parents & I would retire in the heat of the monsoon, in the 1930's & '40's.!

The Oberoi policy of no individual staff tips helps to maintain that feeling (with the single exception of one doorman who clearly expected a tip for opening a door and made his feelings obvious when one wasn't forthcoming). That very minor issue apart staff were extremely courteous and helpful, public areas were clean and comfortable as was our room. Our bed was superbly comfortable.

The restaurant offered great buffets, with a large variety of food. They could have possibly had more non vegetarian food available. If you do go there, don't miss out on the apple jalebi, paan ice cream, brownies and aubergine with salsa.

The rooms are great, and the mix between traditional and modern is quite well done, without being overly gaudy or hopelessly obsolete.

We were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the mountains which was a pleasant surprise. The architecture, furnishing, d√©cor of the hotel is striking. the food in the restaurant was very good - again made even better by outstanding service. It's a ten minute or so walk to the Mall to explore Shimla's shops - wonderful to be able to browse without any hassle and I bought quite a few things here - some lovely shawls, nice (cheap) jewellery. The little lanes snake up and down the town - well worth exploring for the diversity of what is on sale and the colour and vibrancy of the town.

We have stayed at many hotels over the years, often luxury ones with impeccable details and fantastic designs. Price-wise Cecil is on par with other 5 star hotels.  But there is no comparison in terms of its services. Cecil is a luxury place or a Masterpeice. Yet, in ten years from now, I‚Äôm sure we will still fondly remember the vacation we had there.

Thanks to the location, I still felt the peace of the mountains that the Shimla of fifty years ago would have had in abundance. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I would only go to Shimla if were staying at the Cecil. But, what floored me most about the hotel was their service.

We have never stayed in a hotel that has shown such devotion to the welfare of their guests as the Cecil.  We were upgraded to a suite on arrival (for no other reason than they wanted us to feel like guests in their country).  A lady called Neetu took care of us on our arrival showing us to our suite and giving us useful information.  She remembered us each time she saw us asking if we were enjoying our stay and if there was anything she could do.  The Lobby bar in the atrium is an impressive place to soak up the ambiance of the place whilst enjoying a drink or snack.  Food in the restaurant was delicious and the waiters attentive. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.,Date of stay: February 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The heritage interiors of the hotel to the courteous smiles with folded hands staff, right from Mr. Manager's personal warm welcome to being transported in your room with bag and baggage in a matter of few minutes - a highly effective welcome.    Excellent staff, with faultless service.  They make sure that your stay is purely comfortable.  I loved the small details they take care of without your telling them to do so !    Dinning : Breakfast quality and presentation was better than the Dinner.

"Staying at Cecil was a delightful experience- delicious food, great service,(with a smile), large rooms, good location and , finally an unbelievable attention to small details for each individual guest. This last attribute impressed us the most and was omnipresent in housekeeping, restaurant      service, chef's attitude, reception staff, car rentals and chauffeur (We have never earlier had such a pleasant and ""unsickly"" mountain road journey).

Stayed with family for three nights. Stayed here a number of times earlier and always found the Oberoi hospitality as always..... the best. Food is excellent and not very expensive. Staff is very responsive and  very well groomed. On reaching hotel one feels as if you are away from the hustle and bustle of city yet it is 10 minutes beautiful walk to The Mall. One feels like coming here again and again.,Date of stay: June 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Excellent Hotel with well trained staff who genuinely seem to care. Great facilities, lovely walks and just the right distance from the busy and noisy Mall road..which is still close enough to walk to.  Beware of monkeys who would happily enter your room, open the mini bar and enjoy the liquor(not kidding).   The professional staff add significantly to the experience and do everything to ensure that each request is met with a smile and responded to.   The only slip up was that we were initially not given a room on a higher floor as we had requested when we made the booking and an alternate room took almost 1.5 hours to get ready after we had seen it...other than this hiccup we had a lovely stay.",Date of stay: May 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
We visited Shimla after a fairly hectic trip to Manali. So the main intention was to chill out and the hotel was perfect for that. Lot of kid activities kept the kids entertained. The temperature controlled swimming pool was great. We took a stroll to Mall road from the hotel and the hotel car picked us up on the way back. We also used the hotel transport to go to the Glen - which is a great forest walk. Food and the lounge was good and they packed us a huge breakfast since we had to catch a morning flight from Chandigarh. The spa head massage and thai massage was good. The foot massage was not upto the mark and I really hope they improve that since there will be many folks like me - tired after the long adventures in shimla and manali.,Date of stay: May 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Loved our recent stay at The Cecil in Shimla. The hotel transports you back 60-70 years. Beautifully done up- very charming :) the staff was very well trained and professional. The best part of the hotel was the atrium-lounge- great for afternoon tea or cocktails. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and our servers did their best to make our meal a wonderful one whether it was getting freshly baked croissants for us or specially having fresh orange juice made, which was not on the buffet. The Eggs Benedict was delightful. The in-dining fare was reasonably priced, if a little uninspiring. The Cecil is beautifully located- away from the madness of the Mall Road, yet close enough to walk there.

"If you want a reasonably priced hotel right on the Mall, 2 minutes from the lift, but still not on a very crowded stretch, choose Willow Banks. Admittedly, it's not fancy, but the rooms are big and clean and the staff is very helpful. Pratap at the front desk gave us a good deal and a warm welcome, while Negiji in F&B attended to our needs promptly and with a smile.   Suggestions:  - Take the rooms on the top floor, with a city view. We were in 505, next to the lift.  - While it's under a different management and you won't get any discount as a resident guest, try the food at Simla Times Cafe on the ground floor... Absolutely lip smacking!   Reasons for deducting a star: - Furnishings and fittings are old, high time for renovation.  - In-house food is bad. Do not recommend taking the breakfast package. There are dhabas close by too, with much better food.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: October 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The room was spacious, clean and services were quick.  We liked the breakfast buffet and Mr. Kapil Negi from restaurant was very courteous.  Only downside of this hotel is their balcony which on the right side gives you a good Shimla Ridge view but on left side open to their SkyBar and Cafe Simla Times which does not allow to sit and enjoy with your family.  In our opinion, you should not go for Premium room category (offered with Balcony) as it cannot be used.

This hotel is the best in Shimla, views are stunning over the town (sticker on door reminds you not to leave it open to prevent mosquitos and monkeys!) and all the major must see places are within easy reach. We ate in the restaurant for all meals on 2 days as we were so impressed by the food and the service. The choice of dishes was amazing, the beer was well priced and the attentive waiters made us feel so welcome. Our guide was really a mountain goat - the hike upto Jakoo temple proved this - but the temple and the views were stunning. So many fantastic places to visit, things to see and a very happy evening‚Ä¶",Date of stay: February 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel is situated up a hill and there is no road access to it. However there are public lifts that take you up and a three minute walk reaches the hotel. I think this is the best hotel location in Shimla. We received a warm welcome drink and as soon as our cases appeared they were taken to our room. Our room was very large with beautiful view over Shimla. The room and bathroom was dated. The bathroom had plenty  of hot water however the bath was stained and marked and the sink had no plug. When we requested one they did not seem to think it was a problem not to have one. The toilet flush was almost too stiff to press.  The bar and restaurant staff were courteous. They struggled to cope when it got busy but to be fair they managed to call in reinforcements. The menu was varied‚Ä¶,Date of stay: March 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Not suitable for people with some type of disability, because to reach the hotel you need to use the common lift (crowded) and walk for a while up the hill and along the alley until you reach the reception. Misleading information about ‚Äúprivate lift, as it goes only to a certain level. To get to the road you will have to go down an inclined and long stone stair, with uneven steps, which makes the descent dangerous. When we checked out, the public lift was not functioning, so they indicated that path (which we had done the previous day, due to this ‚Äù). It was hard without luggage, let alone WITH luggage, hand luggage but still‚Ä¶  As I saw some cars going up and down, and even parked along the road, the hotel could have at least a golf-cart for these situations.

Has an ideal location at the starting of the mall so you walk out and just start exploring  the mall road bustling with shops, eateries and iconic landmarks. The good part is that the hotel offers a lot to do inside the premises too - restaurants like cafe Simla, their fine dine restaurant where they lay buffet breakfast and the new rooftop bar which opened just the day before we visited.

"There are many goods and many bads. Had it not pinched my wallet that much, i would have easily overlooked those things. But since the hotel charges for a 5 star service, I would criticise on all the expectations which i didn't see.  Everything is costly. Price is quite near to a 5 star hotel but its just a 3 star hotel. And the main reason is the overrated 2 affiliated restaurants that is cafe Simla times and 1871.   Goods:  1. Management tried to reach me via every channel i.e. mail, sms, call to ensure that they received my booking. All that was not required but it felt good. 2. Location of hotel is too good. 3. Room view (2002 super deluxe with small balcony) was also good. 4. Reasonably clean. Had room heater and bath tub.  5. Fast room service.  Bads:  1. Too costly.

"It's such a shame that the owners/management of this hotel have not moved with the times, and do not appear to understand how important it is to make the hotel customer feel like a guest.  The hotel is quite well located, at one end of Mall Road and within 100 metres or so of the main Tourist lift.  We chose a 'Super Deluxe' room for the small balcony, and we did like this - the view is great morning or night, all the way across and down the village and across the valley towards the south-western hills.  The room was also quite a good size.  But this hotel has an inflated sense of its own quality and a high price to go with it.  In fact, it is a perfectly reasonable 3-star hotel.

"The location of the hotel is brilliant. On the mall road and a 5 mins walk from the ridge area. We stayed at the valley view rooms which provide a nice view of Shimla City and the ridge from the balcony.  The adjacent cafe - Cafe Shimla Times also provides nice finger food.  The breakfast is absolutely delicious.  However the rooms are a bit small and the fittings and finish are not of highest quality considering the price you pay. The bathroom is also cramped and you have to stand on a non functional bathtub to get a shower which I thought is very risky for elder people.  Overall very good hotel, but there are some areas they need to work on.  We had a nice trip to Narkanda Thanedar and Mashobra from Shimla.

The staff was good and the food ordered from their restaurants was tasty. They have two restaurants in their complex - Cafe Simla Times and Eighteen71.

Yes, more or less, all the expected services and facilities were there. Still somehow we as a family of three, didn't feel really welcomed over there!   Whenever we were passing through the reception area, sometimes to go outside or returning from the outside, nobody among the staffs present in that area ever greeted us or, even pay any attention to us! we don't know why it was happening that way but definitely it was not a very pleasing experience as the guests.

The soul of a good hotel i.e. ""Hospitality"", ""Customer Experience"", ""Courtesy"" are all missing here. Seems basic attitude coming down from the hotel management is very cheap. You enter into a well made hotel just to interact with an unprofessional staff at the reception who is ready to argue with you for a smallest of sum. They are abosutely money minded people. A staff who will not hesitate in quoting premium prices that they selling same rooms as compared to the ridiculous deal you have purchased online for the same room.

I stayed there for a night during my Himachal trip [had a flight to catch from Chandigarh). Booked it as it looked decent property on mall road (I had stayed at Clarkes earlier but the tariff there was a little higher :) and hence decided to try this one out] Positives : - Mall road location - Open air restaurant serving decent food (open to outsiders too) Negatives : - Room not is good shape (maybe due to lack of maintenance) - Used food plates and cutlery lying for long periods near lift (greased plates)  I would definitely not like to spend more than a night there; decent choice if one is short of time and wants to spend time at Mall road in Shimla..,Date of stay: May 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

We arrived at the hotel just after 10pm and a 10 hour drive to a very cold reception. The receptionist Kuldeep failed to advise the restaurant closed at 10.30 so it was when we thought we could have a quick bite that this episode turned into a comedy sketch. The kitchen and bar were closed so they advised us we could order room service. More of a ploy to get us out of the restaurant probably. So we try to order room service and guess what..... yes the kitchen and bar were still closed. To be fair poor Kuldeep was eventually persuaded to order a take out for us and they did change our room so we could enjoy the views over Shimla instead of a wall. Staff could benefit from simple welcome host training and/or laxatives to ease the constipation. Smiling might be easier!,Date of stay: April 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"We stayed two nights at this nice hotel with its convenient location on the Mall.  Our room was very comfortable with a king bed. The bathroom could have been better if the shower had worked properly. I think there was a problem with the water pressure as it was very low and then suddenly very high which resulted in water all over the floor. Also I think there's a problem with the generator or boiler system as there's a lot of noise coming from somewhere? We changed rooms twice but it was the same everywhere. If you wore earplugs it was ok. Apart from that it was clean, the staff were very pleasant and the food in the cosy restaurant was exceptionally good.  We also enjoyed the proximity of the Mall with its shops, stalls and markets.",Date of stay: February 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

"Nice hotel. Probably one of best in house restaurant in shimla. Helpful staff. Centralised heating system is awesome. Location is probably just 10-15 metres away from government Lift. Only improvement required is little show of Courtesy to their Guests. I actually had to pay for a room upgrade, though amount was small and could easily be waived off. Their mall road facing room was small and claustrophobic. It's just 1.5 kms away from railway station/bus stand and guess free pick up/drop should not be a problem considering the price they charge for rooms.

We stayed for 3 days . The location of the hotel is excellent . But the negative part is getting to the hotel . You have to get to the Public lift paying ‚Çπ 10 per trip plus luggage extra . Or else you have to climb a steep passage and get on the hotel lift   We stayed in a family suite . The rooms were ok . Breakfast was included and they did give a good Indian and continental breakfast.  The room service was good . The bathrooms were big and water is available freely .   The wifi connection is very poor and you can get only by standing in the lobby .

"We stayed in a super deluxe valley view room  No 2002. The hotel itself is charming and the check in good. However the hotel fails to say that these rooms are in a carbuncle of an annexe built onto the back of the hotel, probably many years later. To get to these rooms you need to go out of the hotel reception, walk 50 or more metres through an open air restaurant and then negotiate a lift down 5 floors. The rooms are not up to spec for a 4 star hotel, with no control of heating or cooling. Try the restaurant though.

If you use the hotel lift, you have to walk quite a way up to get there. Nice hotel, lovely helpful staff. Cold in the room but we asked for a heater and that was fine. A bar, a good decent bar they have. It's the first one we'd found on our travels. Beer and Gin & Tonic, lovely, good ambiance.

As a history buff, I was excited to stay in a place with such a storied past that was also close to the main square action and still boasted comfort. While the hotel is still close to everything, it seems to have lost some of its charm.   We had a city view on the top floor. The room was sparse, it didn't even have paintings on the wall. That isn't a big deal, but you lose a bit of figurative warmth that way. Also in terms of regular warmth, they shut the heat off early in the morning.

Can't ask for any more. Perfect Location. Scrumptious Food. Amazing Hospitality. This was our 5th or 6th stay with Willow Bank - Shimla. Every trip to Shimla we make sure that we stay at this hotel only. Hotel is just 5 mins walk from the Shimla Lift (Through which you come up and the car drivers go park in the parking place after dropping.) and you can do some window shopping on your way to the hotel for which you can always go back for some souvenirs later on. Free parking was provided by the hotel which is a very good benefit as we were there for 3 nights and 4 days. It is just 10mins mins walk away from the Ridge.

The view from the hotel room is also very nice. The hotel menu does not provide very vast options but the quality is very nice. One thing which was different was the way they try to keep the food warm in chilling cold weather.

"We booked 3 balcony rooms with view and requested them to give all three rooms together in December.  To reach there: We left from Delhi by Shatabdi and then caught Himalayan queen and reached Shimla at 6:20 pm. It was a long day, but since we had small kids we were avoiding car travel on winding roads. Train was the best option. Once in Shimla, we hired a cab to reach the Mall lift and then took the lift to reach the mall road. From there it was a 10-minute walk to the hotel.   Location: It is a convenient location, neither too far from Mall road nor too much in the hustle of the Mall noise.   Staff: We were greeted by warm and friendly staff with a welcome drink.

Until it stoped raining, we took shelter under the sunshade of someone‚Äôs door shivering and freezing with fear. After we managed to reach the hotel the reception staff were so irresponsible and made us wait for 1 hour to check in. We were practically freezing and dripping in the lobby.

In our package dinner was included and you could order anything from the menu, food was really delicious and the servers were all very attentive.  The only downside of this hotel is that cars are not allowed up to the hotel entrance, so we had to climb steep steps to reach the hotel.

Housekeeping was poor and needed repeated calls and follow up for the phone to be answered.

However, be warned that the hotel has no parking and a considerable walk up if you have the elderly, small kids or are wearing the wrong footwear like I was !! You will spend an hour looking for parking and then walk all the way up to the hotel lift. You will also need to find a porter to carry your luggage at an additional cost. Hotels in the vicinity of willow banks have their own parking and bell boys to carry the luggage. This is a huge advantage.  Their staff is wonderful and helpful.

"Travelled here from a beautiful hotel in shimla itself keeping a postive mind but was terribly disappointed by the service and quality  1. No directions or guidance were given on property location and acess. No parking on site for customers. 2. Found a parking a kilometer away with my own hassle , payed from my pocket for parking and transportation of luggage which you expect the hotel to arrange after paying more than 8000 per night.  3.attitude of the receptionist / manager was terrible .  4. No ambiance , there are workers going across the hotel. The room is just ok . Is not worth more than 4500 per night .  The fittings and the furniture is old and not maintained. 5.no proper lift lobby, you have to walk through the streets to go to the lobby for breakfast .",Date of stay: June 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"The location of the hotel at the beginning of the Mall Road is perfect. The sights on the Ridge are within easy walking distance. The Mall Road is filled with shops, cafes, and restaurants so you can find anything you want.  We ate at both the hotel's cafe and restaurant and had very good meals. The breakfast is a bit limited for Westerner's but certainly adequate. We had a great spacious room with a balcony and view. We found the staff to be totally friendly and helpful. Wifi is limited to the common areas which was no problem for us. To reach the hotel from the parking area you must climb a lot of stairs.They do have a lift part of the way and you still have quite a few stairs to climb but the reward is being right on the Mall Road.

To begin with the location of this hotel is perfect as its right on the mall road. Cafe Shimla Times is the highlight of this property and the food served at the restaurant is pretty good. We mostly had our meals either at Cafe Shimla Times or in our room (in room dining). They upgraded our room FOC which was a nice gesture. Breakfast needs to be improved and they need to take that seriously. Breads probably not changed for 3 days and not that many options for vegetarians.

"If location is your priority, then you can book this hotel without any doubt.It has a very good ambience, services, facilities and staff.View from the room is a plus point. The only disadvantage in booking this hotel is that no vehicle will be available from this location.There is a travel desk in the hotel but it will arrange the vehicle which will have a pickup point 500m away from the hotel.You must get down the steps to get to this point.This inconvenience is because this hotel is located on mall road onto which no vehicle is permitted.

It would be better to pay extra and get a room at the other side of hotel with views all over Shimla.  Negatives - The bath had mould marks.  The toilet paper was like sandpaper.  WiFi was very bad.  Upon leaving the porter who carried our bags and met us at the bottom of the tourist lift demanded 500 rupees, even though we only paid 200 rupees for two porters to carry our luggage up to the hotel on arrival.

"The hotel looks very promising while booking online, but the main problem of the fact that it is on the Mall Road is that, its hard to reach. The car dropped me in front of the lift and there was a 1.5 hours line in front of the lift to reach the hotel. It was freezing cold, so had to walk up there with bags in my hand. Really bad experience. No matter how the hotel is if it is this hard to reach it losses it worth. After reaching there, had no wifi in my room despite having paid for it.

We were given room 406 and the noise and vibration coming through the floor was unbelievable, on contacting reception we were quickly given another room which was quiet and clean with great views over the valley. It seemed to me that all the rooms in the area of 406 would be noisy and vibrating as I could feel it outside the room. We had breakfast in the hotel which was good but no other meals.

They give you a bottle of bisleri and tea coffee free everyday. Rooms are very spacious ,all of them. We got early check-in as soon as we arrived which was huge bonus as we were tired.  Bad part: NOW this is where we were hugely disappointed. Right from the moment you enter the gorgeous hotel reception, the FRONT DESK staff(both morning & evening) are HIGHLY UNWELCOMING.

Hotel willow banks.. This place is most centrally located...  It's right on the mall road next to the tourism lift.  Overlooks the valley and the hills and makes you feel so at one with nature.

"We stayed at this property from the 10th to the 14th of Oct, 2016. Our booking was done on OYO rooms which gave us an amazing rate of Rs. 4000/night including breakfast and taxes.   This property is conveniently located on the Mall Road between the High Court parking (where cars for local tours can arrive) and the Lift (basically two Otis lifts which takes you to and from the Cart Road which is a street where vehicular traffic is allowed). So you have two convenient points of access.   The rooms are large with balconies and lovely wooden finish. Beds are large and comfortable but the pillows were too large for my comfort.

There are two wonderful restaurants with the complex serving absolutely delicious food.. eighteen71 and cafe Simla times.This hotel has a great spa as well which made our spa very relaxing.

Position for walking all parts of The Mall markets.   In-house restaurant (but see later).  Lift.  Comfortable bed.  Bad? It's not possible to drive to the hotel.  This means that you may need to use the tourist lift, as long as it is open. You may find a guide who forces you to use a very long flight of stairs and pay for porters, even if the lift is open.  Very noisy from both inside and outside.  Don't expect to get an early night after a long day.  It's built around a central court, so all internal noise gets concentrated.

For people who may love to be near Mall road Willow Banks is a good option...in fact there are only three good options i.e. Willow Banks, Clarkes or Combermere and all are good but priced differently and Willow Bank being the least costly. The hotel is located at opposite tourism lift, centrally located and claiming to be a four star category which in my opinion is not.

Get off from your cab / car at the Tourist Lift pay the amount for the lift get out of the lift on the mall road, turn right walk one or two minutes and you are there. Mind you the lift has its working time which is 8 AM till 9 PM.   The rooms are spacious, airy and have a balcony. The view however is that of the concrete of Shimla.

Was traveling with my mother who is old and therefore proximity to the mall road is what I wanted, without compromising on the view. Yes it's a view of the colourful shimla houses and valley not the mountains, but a view nonetheless.   It's a 3 min walk from the lift (the lift meaning a physical, building lift and not a cable car! :))  Rooms- clean, better views on upper floor.

Shimla is lovely and the hotel was well located, being situated on the Mall, the main thoroughfare in Shimla where most of the shops and restaurants are located. The hotel was designed and decorated in a heritage style and the room was large clean and well furnished. Only gripe was the breakfast. There was no breakfast buffet, presumably because the hotel was not busy and the menu was fairly limited. The staff came over as a little sultry, did not offer a refill of tea and coffee and the food was uninspiring.

"I personally recommend to stay superb rooms, superb food and services. every staff is so co operative. just near to Mall Road and lift. very nice collection of antique items. Open restaurant with live music awesome. Hot water facilities good. They provide room warmer too. Extra bed should need improvement. Worth to visit",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
The hotel is situated at the one end of the Mall Road .. It's very near to lift and have good access .. The room was cosy and we could get the view of the Shimla from my balcony ... Quite heavy on pocket ... See if you get some good deals ... The food menu is also little bit on the higher side in terms  of the cost ...   It's upto you to decide .. About the cost to pay or not ...that much,Date of stay: April 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"We visited shimla March 2016. We stayed in Combermere, but decided to overstay a day. Since Combermere was booked, we stayed in willow banks, as we got a good deal. The staff are not at all friendly. Rooms are clean and good. They still have TVs from 1980.  Good comfortable choice if you get a good deal. Do not order food from the hotel. 2 cups of tea for 180 is murder. Don't expect anything, enjoy and if possible avoid Shimla.

"This hotel looks lovely from the outside and is in a great location - right in the mall. We stayed for 2nts on my birthday and the staff made me feel so special with greetings and a warm welcome. They put a cake in the room too but nothing to eat it with or on! Lovely gesture nonetheless.   The hotel were making major renovations to a new restaurant. There was dust and major noise with tools and workmen on the go till evening. The noise we could escape by going out but the dust ( which is unavoidable) we could not since our room opened onto and overlooked the work area. The hotel really should have put ALL guests in higher floor rooms. Breakfast was awful. The room was in the basement next to the building work. It was cramped, dusty and dark.

My group came and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of on the go tours. On the face of it the hotel looked lovely and the room was really nice. But that's where it ended. I expected India to be noisy so had some good effective ear plugs and I am so glad I had them. On the first night the hotel renovations went on until 11pm and started again at half 7 am.  The hotel also has the most noisy generator/fan which is blasting noise throughout the hotel from the back stairs. People in my party who were at that end of the corridor had no sleep. On the 2nd night the noisy from construction had finished early after we complained but the noisy generator carried on. The floors of my room were filthy from the dust. My feet were black within 5 mins of getting out of the shower. The‚Ä¶,Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Strategically located near the City Lifts which makes access easy. The property is located right on mall with all important places within walking distance. Well furnished and spacious room and toilet. Courteous and helpful staff eager to respond to your requests. The staff has been trained to anticipate the requirements of customers and fulfill them in advance. The balcony offers lovely view of the Ridge.  Had a very enjoyable and comfortable stay. Value for money.  Some floors are under renovation but it does not disturb the customers. Hope that after renovation it will become more attractive.,Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"This was a good place to stay. We had a sunny southern exposure and view. Room was clean enough, spacious with nice bed and linens.  bathroom is dated and a little worn out but clean. Be aware that renovation of dining room is in progress so lots of dust, intermittent banging, power failures, no central heating ( we had portable space heater) and solvent / paint smells ( which I preferred to sewer smells at many other Indian hotels).  Great location and decent food in restaurant.",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Located quite centrally in the heart of Shimla, this hotel has an old world charm. The staff was very helpful and co-operative and accommodated our request for early check-in without any hassles.

"Booked a premium room for 2 nights from 20th February to 22nd February, 2016.  Rooms are neat and clean.The Bath area needs renovation as the fittings and the bath tubs are outdated..Main advantage being its on the mall road very near to the tourist left.  Had a problem during check out as i had paid the entire room charges online thru their website and only service charges had to be paid on check out, the person had no record of online payment being done, which resulted in almost half an hour of delay as had to check out early, You have to pay for breakfast separately. Overall its not value for money.",Date of stay: February 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
The hotel makes you feel comfortable and lets you relax in Shimla. The wifi speed is the only thing which lacks in the hotel. The hotel staff are helpful. Though the hotel food is good it is advisable to have your food in other restaurants on the mall road. However the bar in the hotel is good and worth a visit.,Date of stay: October 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"We stayed at the hotel for a day but wish we could extend our stay here instead of Radisson . The hotel has an old world charm, is a short walk away from the Ridge, right beside the lift and is home to one of the best cafe pubs in shimla -Cafe Simla Times. The rooms are cosy and i think this place is a great choice to stay in Shimla ...at its price, probably the best!

This was the 2nd time we had been to Shimla and the 2nd time we stayed at the Willow Banks. It is very well located (just 200mtrs from the top of the lift and at the start of Mall road). Renovations are currently occurring so the restaurant is downstairs. Rooms are clean and comfortable but the Wifi only works on the lobby - inconvenient when you are on the 1st floor and the lobby is on the 7th (the lift to rooms actually goes down rather than up at this hotel). The Channa Bhatura is one of the better I have tasted so go for this option at breakfast. This is not the cheapest option in Shimla but for location and ease of access I would recommend staying at the Hotel Willow Banks.,Date of stay: February 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"I stayed with my family and in - laws. This is a good property to stay as the location is very nice. Just step out of the hotel and you are on the Mall Road of Shimla. This hotel is situated at the end point of the Mall Road. The cafe of the hotel is good for family sitting, at night they lit fire in open area with live music. The rooms are nice for stay, the staff is co-operative and soft spoken. The location of the hotel is very nice, near to the Tourists Lift, on the Mall Road, neat and clean. had a very nice and a pleasant stay with them.

"Shimla is not a cheap town to stay in, so the Willow Banks was the most expensive hotel of our India tour.  However, I would definitely recommend it as a place to stay in Shimla. Go for a mini-splurge.  The main reason is location. You are in the pedestrian zone here, so all is quiet. You can also easily walk up to the Ridge.  How different our stay in Shimla would have been if we had been at one of the further out hotels requiring a taxi every time we wanted to go somewhere. So the location is worth the price premium you pay.  Our first room, on the lower level, was as cold as a meat locker. The meagre electric heater could not keep up and the central heating that works at nightime didn't seem to function, so we requested a change of room.

Free WiFi was promised but there were issues in the signal quality in the room. I was not able to avail of this benefit :(  2. I think this place needs a little renovation now. The room door was not in a good condition. The TVs could/should get HD channels now.  3. Travel Desk: Totally avoidable. A day trip to Narkanda was ruined because of this. The driver was rude, unfriendly person. A lesson for the future. You can get drivers on the Mall Road for sightseeing and for cheaper rates too. This way you will interact with the driver beforehand as well.   The above negatives were not deal breakers for me.

It is located about 100 metres from the top of the tourist lift in the middle of Shimla on Mall Road (pedestrian precinct), so is very accessible from the lift car park.  The front desk staff spoke excellent English and couldn't have been more helpful.  There is a restaurant and a cafe which have different menus. We had all our meals here when we weren't away, so this speaks for itself.  One slight grumble, not all of the restaurant staff have good English. So, you wonder if you have got through to them.

Biggest advantage is location as it is situated at The Mall Road. Taxi stand is easily accessible as soon as you come down from the mall road by the government lift which is very close to the hotel.

The walk to the mall or the next door chai stall was easy. The balcony from 302-305 gave a super view of the clutter the Queen of the Hills has become. The food was good and the portions decent. The breakfast was also good and had decent variety. So why a 4 and not a 5? The breakfast area was unmanned, the food was not replenished, requiring request from one r more of the guests. The other thing were the over eager attendants who would hang around expecting tips.

"I stayed at Hotel Willow Banks in May, so it was the most expensive time to go. Room was expensive due to high season and location. The room was very nice, but the bathroom had some issues. Toilet paper holder falling off the wall and the shower did not work properly. Also, I went out for dinner, and when I returned they had turned on the heat (not needed) so room was hot and heater was loud! It was hard to sleep because of the noise (but I'm also a terrible sleeper, so maybe a heavy sleeper would not have noticed).   The location isn't the only plus though. As mentioned above, the room itself was very nice, and it had tea/coffee service in the room. Also, hotel has a nice restaurant/bar attached.

What I liked very much is the distance from the mall road was pretty less, but still it seemed to be nestled in a calm place in a busy street. Very near to the lift also makes things easier. The service is very good, but the food in the hotel was ordinary. So it is better to avoid either food or the breakfast. There are plenty of eating area around, so that is not very difficult part.

We stayed in the premium room since the deluxe was not available, and found it very good. There should not be much difference between the basic and premium rooms since the cost differential isn't too much. The room was nicely done, and the bathroom was clean.

"One can find many decent hotels right at the mall ranging from Clarkes to Willow Banks to Combemere. In our last trip we stayed at Clarkes and the experience was expensive though good. This time around, we chose Willow Banks as we had our 17 month old daughter accompanying us and the priority was that the property should be right on the mall and the room size should be decent so that the kid could play around. After much brain wrecking on tripadvisor reviews, Willow Banks was shortlisted. Clarkes was charging too much.  The check-in process was very quick and smooth.

Nice adequately big  rooms, very neat and clean bathroom decorated with bathtub, hair drier etc., excellent room service. We also liked the restaurant very much... quality of food was very good  though a bit costly. The only negative may be the position of the hotel. You can not reach there by car as this hotel located on the Mall Road. You need to take the tourist lift but most of the time it's over crowded.

If anything, Hotel Willow Banks has improved in all respects in these two years. As usual, the service level was outstanding. Being right on Mall Road, close to the Lift, it is also conveniently located.  When one selects a Hotel, the criteria normally covers Location, Rooms, Tariff, Food, Cleanliness, Facilities and Service quality.

Breakfast spread is good.  Everyone will find something for them.  We requested for a variation in a dish for kid, which was smilingly fulfilled.  The location of the hotel is most suitable for elderly and those with kids, since you can make numerous tips back to the room during the day.  You are saved from hassle at lift too,  that is crowded most of the times during peak season.  The lowest floor rooms don't have a view.

The service was good and they provided blower on request. Wish they could provide umbrellas too during rainy season.

The hotel was also jam packed and hence I attribute some of our service experiences to excess rush.  Location - As mentioned by reviewers before, the location is hotel's biggest plus. Bang on mall road though on the quieter side makes it a plus. Key shopping and eating areas are a short walk away. It is very close to the mall road lift which is again useful.   Getting there - One has to leave their cars at the lift station and get their luggage to the hotel using porters. While we had informed the hotel about our arrival the porter did not reach us.

One MAJOR thing that you gotta keep in mind is that - it is ""difficult"" to reach this hotel if you are visiting in peak season. This applies to any hotel on Mall Road, except few.

The booking process was also not pleasant. Had to talk to the GM of the hotel makes you feel like he is doing a favor by taking the booking.

However, after dumping our luggage and going out to eat we came back still an hour before official check in time and the hotel staff told us our room was ready.

"This is a hotel that is just what you expect for it's price and category. The rooms are spacious and clean, but rather old-fashioned and where nearly everything works - would benefit from a makeover. There was no air-conditioning that we found (although it doesn't get too hot in Shimla) and heating is by plug-in fan heaters.  The staff are courteous and respond quickly when something needs putting right; the breakfast is buffet-style, with both Indian and European items. The restaurant is averagely-priced and the cooking good and freshly-prepared, but it's position at the end of the main section of the Mall left it nearly empty when we ate there.

"Stayed for 3 nights towards end of March 2014. Its one of the better hotels to stay on the Mall Road & its close to the tourism lift. Staffs are generally warm & offer good service. Food was however a bit disappointing. There are many restaurants nearby at walking distance. If you are looking for hotels that open to good scenic view, then Mall Road is not the place to stay as one can see only buildings from most of the hotels on Mall Road. But if you are looking to stay in an area close to shopping / restaurant, then Hotel Willow Banks is indeed a good option.",Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The hotel manager, Mr. Gupta as well as the entire staff of Hotel Willow Banks were very courteous and warm. I was informed about the porter charges well in advance and did not face any problems getting my luggage up to the hotel.   Service wise the hotel stands way ahead of many other hotels, be it room service or food service. However, the food was little expensive.  I would definitely recommend the Hotel for a warm and comfortable stay.",Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Stayed here for 2 nights late january. Wanted a Hotel with easy access to shops etc and this was excellent location on The Mall. Getting bags to and fro Hotel not easy and one needs to ascertain the price of the Porters from Hotel prior to setting off.I'm sure we were overcharged. The Rooms were good but a little dated would have loved one with a view. Meals were excellent and Staff generally helpful. My one complaint was the terrible booming noise from the Disco on both nights we were there it actually shock the place. Thankfully it did stop about 10pm but very unpleasant.

Staff were helpful and obliging in arranging onward transport, changing our room, additional heating (the central heating went off at 0900 and didn't come back on until 1700), and umbrellas when it poured down.  The location on the Mall means you can pop back in between sightseeing and shopping and can also make use of the restaurants in town rather than the hotel facilities.

Almost all hotels at Simla are overpriced andthis one is no exception.  The hotel people make you feel as if they are doing you a favour by offering rooms.Season or no season most of the hotels are overcharging. I stayed in September and for two suites I was charged around 25000 for two nights stay.I was charged this in off season. The food was exorbitantly overpriced.

"For someone who has been to Shimla a couple of times, this Trip Advisor based hotel was a huge disappointment. Yes, it has advantages -- its at the end of the Mall and next to the lift. So you can walk up and down the Mall and come back to the hotel, but its also on the most lonely, un-happening part of the Mall. So if you are paying more for Mall properties, why this one? The heaters were not working and it was snowing in Kufri and bringing down temperatures, the lights went out every 30 minutes and the generators took over 5 minutes to come back even as the rest of Shimla outside the window was in lights.

"I stayed from 11th Jan 2014 to 13th Jan 2014. Hotel Willow Bank as location advantage and it's good property. Couple of negatives are as follows: (1) No Parking facility/service provided by hotel and parking is a big headache in Shimla. It took more than 30 mins for me to find parking space and that too I had to pay Rs. 250/- per night. There is parking mafia and hotel doesn't help at all. I would suggest if hotel doesn't have parking space, they at least reserve sufficient parking for their guests who have confirmed bookings. (2) The mattress was uncomfortable and I couldn't get good sleep both nights.",Date of stay: January 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Great place. Fantastic location. They have no parking, nor do they assist anyone with finding a parking spot. Apart from that it is a very comfortable place. The food left a little to be desired. Especially the breakfast. The bacon was inedible. Not being in a big town can never be an excuse. Don't serve things you are not sure of the quality. And also get some hot water bottles for the rooms. Otherwise a very nice place staffed by simple polite folk who are happy to help.",Date of stay: January 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
We stayed in this hotel during 10th to 13th Jan 2014. First of all this is not a 4 star property in any sense. breakfast served was almost same all three days and taste was not very good. If at all you are booking this hotel book only CP plan as there are many options available near hotel.  Travel desk is very expensive as compare to other taxis. don't book from hotel. The travel boy misguides and charge very high. very small small things which should be there in a 4 star property was not there and spoiled our trip. Not at all VALUE FOR MONEY.

"Stayed two nights. Nice stay in spacious room with balcony. View was nice but partially obstructed. Good shower, comfortable beds. Nice breakfast the first morning. The second morning we required an early breakfast. It was nice that they were flexible about this, but it was brought late and included sandwiches made with stale bread. Service was always professional but not especially friendly. Great location, close to restaurants and old buildings along The Mall. However, using the lifts to get up to the Mall isn't ideal for an early start ‚Äì they didn't start running until 8am (it was a Monday). Wifi did not work at all during our stay.

Our check in was pleasant, and the staff was really helpful. The lobby was neat and clean and almost had a Royal look.

Even as we booked the hotel, we were not too sure how it might turn out to be as we had been thoroughly confused after reading the reviews.

Since, this would have been our first visit to Shimla, we didn‚Äôt want to lose time and money in getting lost. We reached Kalka by Shatabdi and from there we took a taxi( at fixed rates from the taxi stand just outside the railway station) and were later glad that our reservation in Himalayan Queen did not get confirmed.

Great to sit on the balcony in the sun and enjoy the peace and quiet (as with all of India you can't avoid the barking dogs at night). Business centre was a bit overstated as computer keyboard was almost devoid of printed keys, and spacebar worked every second hit. We avoided paying the charge as it took nearly 25 minutes to type 3 quick emails. Internet Cafe on the Mall is better.

Food served which we ordered from room service was pathetic and mediocre but heavily priced. The tomato soup was stinking. 3. Overall prices are quite high both rooms and food.

It has good and clean rooms with pretty well spread in the buffet meals at their reataurant. The management and staff are quiet helpful.

The Mall is the heart of Shimla, with shops, markets, beautiful buildings and restaurants.   The Hotel Willow Banks had spacious rooms, with very firm beds.  Our sheets weren't particularly clean when we arrived but staff were happy to change the sheets when I asked.  Bathrooms were clean and modern with plenty of hot water. Great view from the balcony of Shimla and the mountains. We had breakfast once in the hotel restaurant and it was pretty average so we didn't eat there again.  We found some great places to eat in Shimla though, within walking distance of the hotel.   Wifi was very slow in our room and at times wouldn't connect, but worked well in the foyer.

Sadly, breakfast was not included in the booking which we thought should have been default so that was a let down. The room offered a great view of the valley and had good heating. The bathroom had a bathtub but no plug to hold the water.  Only problem with this hotel is the parking. You have to park near the tourist lift i.e. if you are lucky to find a paid parking and then take the lift and walk to the hotel which is 100 m to the right of the lift.

In spite of the severe cold and snow, the entire property was well heated. There was enough hot water too. The staff were very courteous. Food was of a high standard and reasonably priced, possibly one of the better places to eat in Shimla. And a nice bar - well stocked and good snacks. General housekeeping was good. The only disappointment was that the Sauna and Steam were not working - I was told that was because of voltage problems. But the jacuzzi was and the gym was adequately equipped.

Only inconvenience was the idea of getting porters to carry your luggage up to the top while you take the lift to the mall road.

Positive:  1)Willow Banks hotel is located in the heart of Shimla at the end of Mall Road. 2)The hotel is centrally heated. 3)The food if you choose a MAP plan breakfast and dinner meals have a great spread.Especially the dinner. 4)Staff is couteous. 5)Family Hotel 6)The welcome drinks were served as promised. 7)Positive and happy atmosphere.-Recommened to spend christmas and New years here.  Not So Positive 1)The loud orchestra is located in the dining hall on the 3rd floor can be heard inside your rooms on the 5th floor. 2)The deluxe rooms are weirdly shaped so go for the super deluxe rooms which have a balcony overlooking the mountains. 3)Rates of the hotel are steep and can be relaxed for deluxe rooms.

The food needs to be improved tremendously. Undoubtedly the rooms are clean and well maintained - but the rooms are not well connected.

Once you come up the lift (so the car should drop you on the lift side rather than lakkad bazar side of the highway) after giving your luggage to the authorized porters (it is the closest you get to a feeling of 'surrender' - the lift will only allow you to take handbags and laptops), it is only 100 metres or so after you turn right onto the mall.

We looked at another 'deluxe' room which was identical before we stayed in the 'premier' room and that title is misleading.

"First things first - Willow Banks claims to be a heritage property, but its not. Its a pretty modern hotel built next to an old structure called Willow Banks Bakery , which is now closed down. However, as a hotel it is pretty good. First advantage is the location, which is at the quieter end of the mall road, but not too far off to make it cumbersome to go for walks twice a day. Since there's pretty much noting else to do in Shimla, except enjoy the walks on mall road, this becomes an important advantage for the hotel. We had a Superior room, on the 5th floor.

Must have been a kennel nearby because many dogs were barking well past midnight each of my three nights there. The rooms are large but the furnishings are rustic, and not charmingly so.

"Never book & pay for the rooms at the Hotel Willow Banks, Shimla in advance for the following reasons: 1.	Not only they claim to have ‚ÄòNo cancellation policy‚Äô but will also not allow you to check out  unless you have paid the full amount for the days you have booked their rooms (a kind of veiled threat), even if you are ready to forgo the advance paid to them. You are forced to shell out the full amount (whether you stay there or not) and you are informed that vouchers would be given for your future stay at the hotel which can be used within the specified period of few months. 2.	If you book their deluxe rooms, there is no guarantee that you will get them as you have already tied your hands by paying in advance.

"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with with my wife in January, 2009. The hotel is good overall the biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is on the start of mall road i.e. if you come on mall road by lift, the hotel is arnd 50 mtrs from there,   The hotel ambiance is very good, thought it is bit costly due to its location but its a good hotel esplly if you go during off season, Hotel staff is courteous enough, it has its own restaurent and has all types of cousines.  The hotel has gym, spa, sauna also which is, i think its USP.

"We chose this hotel as it seemed to be a good mid-way option between the luxury Oberoi properties in Shimla and some of the more basic accommodation.   We paid for a premier room which came with a large King bed (which they can split into two single beds) and a small balcony. We asked for a room on the top floor which had the best views and the most sunshine. The view was partly blocked by another wing of the hotel. The room was comfortable, with a small TV and sloping ceiling.  The bathroom was a little tired but perfectly adequate.  Where the hotel fell down was the service - which was quite cold and occasionally brusque.   The food at breakfast was terrible.

Here there was a constant sound of gushing water - so we ended up on the floor below. This was above the restaurant.

I would not recommend the lower two floors, they seemed rather dark and cold. For India, this is truly a good hotel and it's not expensive at all by Western standards. The restaurant is good and trustworthy. Room service is very fast and helpful.  As in most hotels in Shimla, this one too is very popular with Indian families with children.

"It was an awesome experience here! Our stay was short (2 nights) but the service, food, ambience, etc. all won our hearts.  We came from chandigarh and truth be told weren't expecting much after our dismal stay there. Climbing the slope to the hotel didn't do much good for the image as a first impression. But boy did they surprise us with the exemplary service.  Breakfast and Dinner were simply awesome. Plus to top it off the personnel there helped us with anything as and when needed. A very small example is we had asked for some rotis and my wife didn't have a plate for roti on the table. The person who brought our roti glanced at our table as he came out of the kitchen, noticed there's no plate for it. He went and picked up a plate and then brought it to serve us in. Minor gestures but go a long way in the hearts of the customers.  Then we had a private jacuzzi experience which was even better üòç  Our candle light dinner in 3 degrees temperature with a bonfire nearby was an experience of a lifetime.  The entire staff needs to be commended for the service they are providing. I wish I could name all of them here personally but I only got the name of one of them - Omprakash who helped us with our dinner arrangements and anything we needed to be brought to the room. We never had to reach out to room service.  We also had a hiccup of our bathroom door getting locked at 4 in the night.

But a level of service is assured at all times , which makes this hotel at one end of Mall Road a recommended option of stay . A couple of times the room service wasn‚Äôt attended to and then inflexibility to address small requests is the reason for my 4/5.  Also I chose the club room initially but what was shown on website was t the room I got , which was a bit dissapointing . Then to make matter worse , the other club room which was given was very uncomfortable. The bottom room gets squeaky wood voice from upper room. And the upper room has tin roof due to which animals and birds sounds from outside was very disturbing. I had to change to another room‚Ä¶",Date of stay: September 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

They have maintained their property very well and everything about this hotel is just wonderful .

The hotel is located at a walking distance from Mall Road and the view of the valley was also good from the hotel.  If you are planning to visit Shimla an book this property then I would strongly recommend to not use Google Maps in that area as there are many Sealed Roads with heavy fine for defaulters that is not shown in the map. It's better to ask locals for direction and the nearest and famous point is Marina point that you should ask for.

Thanks to all associates of Honeymoon Inn to offer us that just we needed to. The hotel is situated on mall road but a little efforts to walk for 3-4 minutes slight upwards makes it a peaceful den to find or confined in beauty of nature.

Reception staff members were professional and gave excellent advice. Kitchen and waiting staff deserve recognition as do the porters who carried at least two large cases in their backs to our awaiting taxis in readiness for the next leg of our journey.

Ample of activities to do in the hotel to keep you engaged. Staff is co-operative and food is just awesome. I would recommend to go for buffet meals while you book as it is value for money compared to ala carte.  Some minor things which I disliked was the room interiors. It could have been better.

The rooms are awesome and the views are just beautiful from the rooms we got. The food was good and the hotel staff was supportive.

If the steep road to access the hotel is ignored this property truly deserve 5/5. Many will find the steep slope difficult to climb.  We have been allocated room facing the city near the reception area. Great view of garden & city as well and more importantly early morning sun directly coming to room amazing.  Restaurant is behind the reception which serves great breakfast that suits best to both people with Indian taste & western as well. The fresh Kiwi shake was amazing.  Room service & staffs were awesome. We had early morning checkout & they packed our breakfast without even informing us.

The rooms and club facility is very good. We stayed in a Deluxe room, it was equipped with a heater, however is was insufficient in the January cold. But the plus point was another heater under the bed which did the trick and we could sleep peacefully warm. General facilities like TV, Sofa, table, wardrobe, dental kit, shaving kit, slippers, towels etc were available.

It is up quite a steep hill which has to be tackled on foot for the last 150m because of Shimla's traffic-free policy.

I happen to be a very frequent visitor to Shimla (mostly for business) and frankly speaking I have many a times shied away from booking this place purely because of its name.

However by the next morning we found that everything, bed, cloths, towels, walls and floor were damp! This probably has something to do with the room not having any ventilation. They did move us to another room when we asked too.   Access to the hotel is poor. Firstly you can't get a taxi anywhere near the hotel, so it's a walk from the drop off point. Signage to the hotel was nonexistent. Then it's s trek up the track to the hotel grounds, followed by a lift ride up to the reception. Hard work!

"We visited Shimla in year Feb, 2011 so apologies for writing this review so late. We stayed for ~4 days and loved this hotel and just enjoyed our trip. Location is not too far from the mall road.. rooms have some amazing beautiful natural views. Dining room also had lovely outside views. Hotel staff was very supportive and helpful.. this was located at some good height so we did lot of walking (cum trekking) instead of using lifts. Food was awesome -- we enjoyed our breakfast as well as dinner too. Whenever we will visit Shimla, I would undoubtedly choose this hotel only!!!",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
My wife and I visited this hotel in Nov 2014  The hotel is located within easy walking distance from the mall  The rooms all have stunning views of shimla and the mountains  The restaurant is bright and modern with a buffet style although we took most of our evening meals in our room the breakfast was lovely and the view was stunning  The only warning is the path to the hotel is very steep but a porter is available to carry the bags,Date of stay: November 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
its small comfortable property. the food tastes awesome. highly recommended.  rooms are comfortable. if any issues....staff is too cooperative. only drawback is it's location....coz one has to climb steep up...no vehicle is allowed from a certain point. hotel sends a person to take it luggage...but little tiring. not recommended for aged person  and small kids... walkable distance from mall road.... overall a good place,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"We stayed here for 2 days, selected this hotel after going through some reviews on Trip advisor, though it lacks parking space and to reach here you have to walk a bit hill. But this all gets compensated by views from Hotel. As this hotel is on hill and No vehicle entry Area so one can feel calmness and freshness of Shimla though you are staying in the heart of city. View of Shimla from hotel is also plus point. Also there are lots of Deodar trees surrounding the hotel. Room was well-maintained. Mall road and all other points like Scandal point are walk-able through road which is No-Vehicle Road. Breakfast at Restaurant was good. Overall, we had nice stay and memories of our trip.

Food served at the breakfast/dinner buffet was very good and had great variety. Staff are efficient and helpful.

Our 3-yr old daughter fell sick during the stay and the staff was considerate enough to give lime water, hot water and milk without any charges. 4. Buffet breakfast variety of options. 5. Wi-Fi was reasonably fast.   Negatives - If at all any negatives, it has to be the location. While it is closer to the Mall road, we need to walk a steep 500 mt (at 10 mins walk) to reach the hotel.

Rooms were moderately clean. the carpet had probably not been cleaned in ages and there were a lot of stains on the carpet. Bed sheets and pillow covers moderately clean. Don't think there is a lot of washing that happens due to water shortage at hill stations.

The only con to this hotel would be there is no car parking available at the hotel and car is to be parked in paid parking area nearby and there is a short steep  walk to the hotel (  not for senior citizens)though there will be help for your luggage .

Walking distance from Mall road and stunning views from the rooms. But that's not all the truth about this lovely hotel.  They would usually manage the booking from their office in Delhi, and I had a such a sour experience with the staff there. Even after paying the full amount days before,  they did not have my booking on the day we were suppose to arrive. Instead of listening to me, Mr. Simant and other people did not want to check their systems and blatantly told me that they had no booking for me.

The slightly steep patches of upward access road may be challenging for older or physically challenged guests. However it's not a problem for otherwise guests who are fit. In fact, the climb is worth the panoramic view of Shimla you get from the windows. We reached quite early before check-in, but were quickly accommodated in a plush and comfortable waiting room. The check-in was fast and hassle-free.   Rooms are spacious, tastefully designed and very comfortable. Restaurant serves very good B/F & Dinner buffet. Serving staff is friendly and professional.

If you are travel with kids there is no outdoor game facilities but they do have some indoor activities like karaoke singing, x box, Pool, Carom, Chess etc... The only downside I found like most of my fellow travelers is the steep walk to the hotel from Mall Road. Its not an issue with adults but its definitely tiresome to kids and elderly.

The Hotel is located near to Mall Road and the Chief Ministers official residence and thus the area is very quiet and peaceful which is a boon for people looking to stay away from the hullabaloo. The Hotel is located at a steep climb which may be tough for senior citizens. Though a slight negative but this insulates the property from any noise whatsoever.  The rooms were very comfortable and clean. They have 24 hours running hot water, heated blanket and offered a fanatsic view of the hills and the city.

It was a summer vacation and a family Time. Though we were on a family vacation ; I would say Honeymoon Inn made it second Honeymoon for all of the 3 couples. The location is just amazing. While you think of Shimla ; a city of hilly resorts and houses ; Honeymoon Inn proved out to be a perfect place on Hills of HImachal. Staff is just superb and they provide the luggage pick up service from bottom side of the resort ( mall road) as there is no scope of vehicle to move upside the resort. We got 3 rooms next to each other and had a lovely view of valley. The sit out area in garden is unique and can remind of Royal Families  staying in such locations.

"We were in Shimla during our Holidays in Himachal in October 2016. Although we were slightly apprehensive while booking due to steep climb to approach hotel, all this was laid to rest once we reached Honeymoon Inn. Right from Check-in to check-out, the hospitality was top class. The rooms were clean and tidy and service was amazing. To be precise, it was 5 star quality. The food was amazing. I would definately recommend Honeymoon Inn to anyone visiting Shimla.",Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Pros    Nice View from Hotel Room and away from city's hustle .    Hardly 10 min distance for Lower bazaar and mall road   Food is OK but should try other option like hide out cafe and cafe in Simla or Sol cafe  Service is good and staff is also well professional.  They arrange pick and drop from airport and visit of near by places   Con  Rooms are not at all sound proof ...u can clearly hear the voice of TV channels played from your next room and that's irritating. If this people work on this then this will be the best place to stay in Simla .,Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Hotel is situated very near to pedestrianized shopping on Mall Road. This is very near to the point beyond which no motorised vehicle is allowed thus less walking.  Scenic view from the room is very good and garden area with music for light walk is ideal. Rooms are well lit and spacious for 2 adults and 1 child.   Staff are very courteous and well behaved.,Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
We visited Simla at mid of October.It is well maintain Hotel. Behavior of the staff is good.But some of the  staff always want or try to want tips.This is very embarrassing for travellers who are in out station with limited cash in hand. At the time of living hotel all staff (including restaurant staff also) want tips.We can not paid all of them.This is very embarrassing condition to us.But in Manali we never face such type of problem.,Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"The room was clean and we could walk to the mall (the main tourist area of Shimla).  The staff was nice enough, but a little pushy.  On several occasions we went to the restaurant to find not a person there to help us, or show us a menu.  There is also the huge hill that you have to climb in order to get to the hotel.  A nice man will carry your bags up this hill, but it's still an inconvenience, particularly on check in and check out.  We also found that our room was not very soundproof at all.  They keep music playing in the front garden all day, and we could hear it like it was playing in our room.  We also heard our neighbours every night.  The view from our room was nice, and the place was fairly clean.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

"The hotel room at Honeymoon Inn was spacious and comfortable, with a gorgeous view over Shimla. However, we felt this hotel was a bit overpriced compared to other places we stayed in India, and we found the reception staff to be unhelpful. For example, several days before we arrived, we discovered that they had actually canceled our booking without our knowledge (they had sent us an email asking us to confirm the booking, which we hadn't received while traveling, and when they got no reply they canceled the booking). They then insisted the hotel was full, but eventually we managed to convince them to allow us to re-book our room.

"We had a reasonably pleasant stay for 5 nights in the Honeymoon Inn. It took us a little while to understand the workings of this ""locals hotel"" as we are used to, I suppose, International style hotels. What we take for granted, didn't happen.  We had to ask for everything e.g. a heater (it's cold in Shimla), drinking water, toilet rolls, the bed sheets were not changed throughout our stay . . . Our room was clean and the bathroom was ""new"" but the hot shower was merely a dribble.  The buffet breakfast was a fine spread of Indian dishes.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Indian breakfasts.  We went on 1 tour arranged by the hotel.  A mistake!  There is basically nothing to do outside Shimla.  I would not advise taking any trips organised by the hotel.

We stayed there in month of July that to during Eid vvacation and we had booked a deluxe room but on our arrival they upgraded our room to honeymoon suite without any extra charges and helped us with early checking also...

I stayed in Honeymoon Inn with my wife and kid for 3 days, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable and comfortable stay.  Location of the hotel was a clear winner for me. The hotel is located on the Mall Road, but towards the fag end of it where there is probably 5% of people as compared to the main areas of Mall Road (near the Tourism lift and the Ridge).

"The fact that i am writing this review a long time after my honeymoon, should be enough to indicate how beautiful our experience was during our stay here in Nov. Shimla was our first honeymoon destination and i don‚Äôt think we could have stayed at a place better than Honeymoon Inn. Although it is located near Mall Road, it still keeps you away from the noise and crowd of the town as it is build on a height compared to its surrounding. You have to walk up a short steep slope which leads to an elevator, which then will take you to the hotel property.

I must say though the property is not very big ( please don't expect it to be like a resort with lots of open area) but it is very well maintained .  So let me begin with some positive points :-   Whatever the facilities they have they are properly maintained. For example they have a very small Spa but it is very well maintained. Also they have a very nice neat and clean play/activity area where you can play snooker, X box, watch movies/matches, listen music etc.  They also organize disco nights within that area , which is small but sufficient for couples or small groups.

Location  10/10 At Good height hence breathtaking views of the mountain valley from all rooms.  You should not miss the sunset time!

Stayed there for 3 nights at the clubhouse suite. The room is very good and well maintained . The hotel is very quaint and nice . Staff very courteous and polite & very accommodating & helpful . The food quality has room for improvement and the breakfast buffet could be improved .

"Good things:  1. The view of the mountains 2. Vicinity to Mall Road (you can just walk)  Not so good things:  1. The staff is haughty, which you don't experience even with luxury hotels 2. I asked for feedback booklet but I was not provided with one 3. The room, bedding, blanket, sheets stunk for some reason, and I had to ask for them to be changed which they reluctantly did. Also, despite asking for room freshener to be sprayed at least 3-4 times, they said yes and did not spray it. 4. Tea served was pathetic and the staff did not understand how to prepare it despite clear instructions. 5.

The hotel is beautifully loacated on top of Shimla. It gives a breathtaking view. Food is good too. Cons: Service bit poor. They dont give you mineral water complimentary but give you filter water... I had never ever experienced this in any hotel. Every hotel gives atleast 2 bottle complimentary for a day. Even coffee satches are given limited. No parking available. One has to walk a lot to get to the hotel and that too the reception is at 4th floor. But because of it this has the view.

The buffect breakfast was good and had a little less options in south indian food, rest assured it had some hotdogs and sandwiches. We stayed in deluxe room and had good sleep quality and clean toilets.   Service to room was also fantastic and crew at the reception were helpful too. We stayed there for a night and was with friends and family. I think it surely derserves the rating that presently it holds. Cheers to HN property.

The best hotel to stay with best in class amenities. The lawn area is amazing and can have amazing food served in the open lawn. The staff is very courteous and helpful taking care of all our needs. I have been a frequent visitor at this hotel just for the supportive staff and beautiful views of the Shimla. The only challenge is you need to walk a steep slope to reach the hotel but once you reach there it is worth it. There will be a porter to carry your luggage to the hotel.

"Scraped my knee on their cracked bathtub floor and they didn't even bother to provide an antiseptic or band-aid even after asking for 2-3 times. We stayed at this horrible hotel for one night at the honeymoon suite and the experience was nothing less than a nightmare. Staff was extremely unpleasant and discourteous. Bed was small and jerky. The laces and curtain tied around the bed to give it a ""romantic"" touch were torn from places and looked downright tacky. Food was oily and bland. Only order Indian items on the menu. We made a mistake to order pizza and grilled sandwiches and couldn't eat even half of both.

"Before I review about this hotel, first of all I would like to share most important keynote for any traveler who are looking to book hotels at ""The Mall Road"". The Mall Road is long lane having lots and lots of shops for food, shopping and relaxing too. This street is on uphill side on Shimla. Now please note this road is restricted road and vehicle are not allowed to go. So if you are making a booking for a hotel then please do cross check how much distance you have to walk by yourself to reach hotel. Most hotelier misguide just to encourage bookings. So please do keep this point in mind. Also there is a 'HP' passing cars have privilege over other state cars. So I suggest make sure your tourist vehicle reaches to the maximum point near to the hotel as big tempo travellers  are‚Ä¶",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Went here in Nov'15 for a family trip and we booked 3 super deluxe rooms. Having been here earlier, I knew what to expect and this is my 1st preference in Shimla. The hotel is situated on the fag end of the mall road beyond Shimla Club. This area is very quiet as it is away from tourists. The hotel has no parking (just like most other hotels in Shimla) and has one of the most tiring ramps to access the lift from the mall road. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this hotel for old people and people who have difficulty in walking as the ramp indeed is testing. However for people who dont mind this, trust me, this is the best hotel in Shimla apart from the star hotels. Rooms are excellent, big and airy overlooking the valley.

The rooms of the hotel are large and well decorated specially the swing in our room was very comfortable. Even though the lawn of the hotel is small but it is very well maintained. I must mention the quality of food served in the restaurant. It was diverse as well as tasty.  One must go for the MAP package to get a value for money.

Honeymoon suite is larger, has a swing and a bathtub. The bed looks great, but is round in shape (see below).

Located at less than a kilometer from The Mall road and surrounded by nature, Honeymoon is a great place to stay in Shimla. We stayed here for two nights and it was a very comfortable stay. The hotel construction is somewhat unconventional (but good), in the sense that to reach the hotel rooms you need to first take the lift from the entry of the hotel (which is unattended) to the reception, where you will be well greeted by the hotel management and staff.

I felt sorry for the Sherpa that carry's your bags up to the hotel. The food is excellent the service was even better you had your waiter that looked after you during your stay. The Hotel needs to give you access to the Pool table and movies right through the day not just from 7.30 PM to 10.00 PM.

"This hotel is not the best property around in Shimla. I too followed up on rating on Tripadvisor as it was rated #2 when i was searching back in November 2014. I found that its highly overrated. the hotel is perched upon a hill and cannot be accessed using a vehicle as you have to walk up a steep slope to get to the gate of the hotel. the hotel has nothing fancy in it, as the rooms and premises are basic. Since its on the slope of the hill you get great view out of the windows which is the one of the positives about the hotel. the food is above average but not great. the best part about this hotel is its employees (the room staff only) the guy who turned up help us with the luggage was very polite was very informative about Shimla and gave us good guidance on how to go about‚Ä¶",Date of stay: November 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

"A hotel good enough just for staying - but do not expect it to offer an experience. Everything is functional, a little cramped in Shimla style, and very plain.  Location is close to the mall, if walking around a kilometer is not an issue. A coolie from the hotel is prompt to come and pick your luggage from the road, where you are supposed to leave your taxi and wait for him.  Maybe, because of the way it is build, voices from next room can be heard, which may not be very comforting.  Breakfast was good, but lunch and dinner could have been better.",Date of stay: April 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The location of this hotel is at the Mall road but it involves at 200m walk up the hill to access the hotel. I was travelling with my parents ( 63 and 67 years), this climb was my biggest worry. But the hotel sent a car to ferry my parents, wife and daughter. The porters carried the excessive luggage that we were carrying. The view of Shimla from our rooms more than made up for the difficult climb to the hotel. The staff is very friendly, the food in the cafeteria is excellent.

When we spoke with goibibo, we were suggested to speak with the customer manager (SIMANT MAHLOTRA) explaining him the situation to cancel the stay for a refund. We were aghast at the attitude of the manager towards this request. He said that since this booking was done through goibibo, he WILL not help. We should not be talking to him and its not his problem that we have to cancel our stay. Not only did he refuse to help, he didn't even bother to care for the reason we explained to him.

Stayed here for 2 nights. The room was nice and cosy. The staff was welcoming and courteous. The food was fine as well. Has the advantage of being close to the Mall road and yet very serene. Because of its height gives a good view. The only drawback may be was that a taxi/car can't go all the way upto the hotel as Shimla administration doesn't allow vehicles on the mall road. So have to walk a quite steep 150-200 mtrs. Rest all is very nice.

"Ever heard of someone telling you to travel to hills during rains. Here, I personally recommend you to visit Shimla during monsoon (July ‚Äì Aug).  The surprising skyline with changes almost every hour provides you a scope of viewing hills in its splendour. The cover of lush greens punctuated by white clouds and fog gives you an experience of lifetime.   Of course, your choice of visiting season must compliment with the hotel, where you stay. I will remain a happy visitor of Honeymoon Inn. I am thankful to the hotel management and Makemytrip for the off-seasonal offer.

"My Second stay in the hotel. It was as good as it was in 2007, though now they have made one more hotel building. Good Staff, Tasty Food (Good Variety both in breakfast and dinner), Fast service and perfect managerial staff.  But this being a very good hotel, should now take care of few things like the road leading to hotel should be repaired, the rooms should now given a facelift as they are same as we saw in 2007, though very good, but something can now be redecorated.

"This hotel is located very close to the Mall Road. The only point against the location is that you have to climb around 100 metres uphill to reach the hotel but then its worth it. The hotel is situated at quite some height, surrounded by beautiful trees and takes you very close to the nature. Very peaceful and away from the hustle bustle of the city.  The rooms are very spacious with excellent view from the rooms and have free wifi facility.  The food at the buffet is awesome with a good variety. The outside view from the restaurant is beautiful.

We booked super deluxe room, but it was upgraded to Honeymoon special room(may be due to availability in non season time during March ).

"This hotel made me fall in love with Shimla. Everything about the hotel is so nice, their service, their food, their rooms, comfort.. The super deluxe rooms were beyond compare.. Hotel location is amidst deodar trees which makes it even more serene and cool. Their breakfast buffet was awesome, food taste was too good. The sunset view from the room was too good. The hotel staff was very courteous and made us feel at home. Mall road is very near from the hotel which makes it ideal for an evening walk. The hotel is on top of a hill, so cars are allowed up to a certain point after which one needs to walk to the hotel.

One of the best place to stay in Shimla. The quality of service and food were comparable to those of 5 star Hotel. The view from the room is majestic. They have a sunset point overlooking the valley giving one a sense of peace and tranquility.  The only downside is that they do not have parking facility and you have to walk all the way up to their hotel.,Date of stay: December 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Excellent hotel. Good service. High Quality food. Great rooms. Hard to find a negative in this hotel. Ok Got one negative- Distance is the real spoiler. What takes a toll is the distance you travel is almost vertical and by the time you reach the hotel youre half dead. But the hotel is really out of the world experience. What a view it has to offer with great service and good food. The staff was so extra ordinary that they arranged a candle light dinner for us at a very short notice at no extra cost.

"We stayed for three nights in a honeymoon special room and let me first put the negative points. I personally feel cleanliness should be improved. While they arrange cab/taxi for the local sight seeing the reception guys get some 20% of commission from the cab drivers. Wifi speed is not good enough. Since I am from south India, there were no south Indian channels available to watch. Vehicles cannot go near to the hotel.  Positive Points to be considered: Very good food quality with variety of options. Mall road is easy to access Room service is good enough Games like pool, xbox, carom, chess etc are available Felt the room cost is OK.

"I stayed at Honeymoon Inn, Shimla for 3 days and 2 nights and had booked the Honeymoon special room.   The hotel is a few meters off the hustle and bustle of Mall road yet close enough for a stroll. You have to climb a few steps up to reach the basement of the hotel and take the lift further up to reach the reception. We got room 309 which was on the top floor of the hotel and hence had a very good view from the room. I guess the views from all rooms should be equally good as the hotel is at quite an elevation when compared to other hotels in vicinity.

"Let me guide you to the hotel.  First, reach the last motorable sport of the mall road, ie. just near the Marina hotel. Then you give a call to the Honeymoon Inn Reception and someone would come down to help you with your luggage and take you to hotel.  Then there is a steep 200 m walk-through. When i say steep, I actually mean STEEP. Finally when you reach the doorstep, you THINK you are there, but then you are asked to further take a lift to 4th floor of the building. Reaching the reception at 4th Floor, you get the keys to your room, and further climb stairs to 2nd floor to reach your room. Out of Breath!  So all in all you must be 3 floors (steep walk) + 4 floors (lift) + 2 floors (room) = 9 floors above the mall road level!

Worst hospitality (Whatever you ask for to the staff their first reply was in denial mode. This happened to us on couple of occasions - Requesting access to XBOX games in evening when there were no people on DJ floor, asking for laundry service on 2nd day - they had not informed us about the timings-our MAP package had 4 free clothes to be covered in laundry. 2.

As we walked and reached the hotel I was a little angry upon them as there was no sign near the lift which way to go. Once we entered the lift we found a sticker against the no 4 which says reception. But after we reached the reception everything else went fine.. Thanks to their nice food and the friendly staff. Later in the morning I became friendly with the reception staff and even requested them not to mind my last nights behavior.

"The hotel is very good in terms of interior, service, food quality, size of rooms etc. Stayed there for three nights and enjoyed. Do try for club rooms if you are higher number of guests and want to stay together. Also you can try if you are having children. The club rooms have private balcony also. The staff was very good and always helpful. MAP packages of hotel are value for money. Only negative point about the hotel is steep approach which cannot be done by car. One tip for management, you can try battery operated small cars if authorities allow.",Date of stay: November 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"It has one of the best locations, except the steep hill. The car does not go till the hotel gate (nearest is the hotel Marina parking lot which I guess is 400 meters away, from there one gets hotel porter to carry the luggage). So, for elderly people, it may be a challenge. Property was calm and noise free.  Stayed @Super Deluxe room and must admit it was pretty well decorated and clean. Room service was good. Food at the in house restaurant was again superb. Shimla mall was in walking distance (no vehicles are allowed on mall road, so need to walk). Hotel staff were pretty courteous and always eager to help you.  Overall from my side, this property is highly recommended.",Date of stay: October 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Absolutely delighted with the service that the hotel offers.  I had done the booking over a call and they didn't ask me to pay until we were checking out!  The stay was marvelous. The hotel more so! And again, service was mind-blowing.  The only let down when we visited was that each of the buffet meals had at least one poorly made item.  This may be a bit more expensive than other hotels, but definitely worth the cost.",Date of stay: July 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We rang but nobody came, we then walked to the hotel, up a steep hill, then up avert steep path and then a lift to the 4th floor where reception is. We were welcomed, but there was apology for nobody collecting us. We were given 3 rooms, facing the front 1 of them a honeymoon suite with a round bed.

Made up my mind for this hotel after positive reviews on tripadvisor. It was a great stay with family. Location is bang on mall road with a 2 min ride to the hotel lift. Due to this the room offers great views of the valley. There was a swing in the room which was enjoyed by us and kids a lot. Room was large and spacious. I have opted for a CP plan including breakfast buffet which offers a large variety and equally tasty food. Also the main course meals are good.

"Our overall experience of Shimla was not very great and I guess this hotel also had a role to play in that. Coming from remote areas of Himachal like Sangla and Kalpa, we found Shimla very crowded and commercial and people were very extremely money-minded.   We were also not very happy with our stay at Honeymoon Inn. Our biggest disappointment from the hotel was the room. In photos, both on tripadvisor and the hotel website, the rooms looked very good but in reality it is not the case. Our room had a stunning view outside but inside it was not good. The bathroom was small and smelt of stale air.  Hotel offered complementary breakfast. The food was above average and there was a good variety but the staff had a very cold attitude.

The restaurant staff especially is very courteous and helpful always serving with a smile. A special word of thanks to Naresh and Balbir (the ever smiling guy) who have been extremely supportive. As Mall road has restricted vehicle entry, you will have to walk down for 3 minutes to reach the hotel which includes a 2 minutes climb. The advantage however was that i kept losing all the calories I would gain by relishing the sumptuous meals in the restaurant. In the evenings, a walk down Mall road is completely peaceful and safe even if you have little kids along.

The Hotel obliged by sending Car to pick up luggage and 4 ladies from where our Bus was not allowed to travel further, right upto the elevator.  Hotel is located at one end of the core Mall of Shimla and as such, you do not have two directions to walk to look up the city. cars can travel almost upto doorstep.

"We visited Simla and stayed at the Honeymoon Inn in November last year for 1 day- 1 night. I had great expectations from the hotel but ended up fairly disappointed.  The hotel is far from the bus station but does not provide pick up facility to match the timings of buses coming from Delhi. I agree these buses arrive at 6 in the morning which is very early, but all the more reason to provide this service. Guests are required to walk some distance from the taxi drop point as the taxi cannot go till the hotel (i guess this is not under the control of the hotel management, but this point needs to be highlighted).  Since we reached the hotel early in the morning, understandably there was no room available as it was much before the check-in time.

What you get here as a package(room+service+food+views) is real value for money.  Some things to consider: 1. Parking is not available. We have to make our own arrangements. Nearby high-court parking is usually available. 150rs per day 2. From parking, to reach the hotel is a climb and not easy for elders. For luggage, porter is available(Chargeable). 70rs 3.

"This is Mukesh kithania from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh to be Telangana, i had checked in on 4/5/14, room no : 201, with a check out date of 6/5/14, but due to ill mannered & abusive behaviour of Mr. Amod Singh (GM) we were forced to check out on 5/5/14, in the rainy weather with 4 ladies & 5 children, facing alot of difficulties. I advice you to avoid such a hotel where in the GM himself behaves so abusive in front of children, & who himself talks so shamelessly to his guests. He also threatened us by saying that he will not let us reach home as if we are his servants & not guests, he also man handled me by hitting in the chin with his elbow & when we complained to speak to the higher authority of the hotel, the GM was all ready to walk out of his job, as if he is not bothered‚Ä¶",Date of stay: May 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

"Hotel Honeymoon Inn Shimla, truly does justice to its name. It would be a great hotel for honeymooning couples given its location. Well as normally happens the advantage becomes sometimes a weakling. The hotel is just located at the start of the Mall and at a height. If you hire a car to reach the hotel then the car would take you till Hotel Marina. From there it's an uphill walk. Though porters are available to take your luggage to the hotel. But still for aged people this might prove to be a problem. Otherwise this is a great hotel from every aspect.",Date of stay: April 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

This is one stellar property. Located away from the hustle bustle yet in the midst of everything. The Club House Room (M.D.'s Suite) that we were put up in was excellent. The view from this room was good. The service - excellent. The staff - courteous. The only negative - the walk on the hill to reach the hotel. My suggestion - use an electric car to ferry the guests up from the Marina Hotel point.,Date of stay: April 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Hotel is well situated for a stroll along the Mall and had lovely views across Shimla. Four poster bed but the decor was a little dated but room was clean and it was a bonus to have a heater. No complimentary mineral water but free wifi was available which was a bonus. Restaurant was good and good selection for breakfast but staff a bit slow at setting up. Timings for breakfast and dinner could do with expanding as not everyone wants to wait until 8am for breakfast or 8pm for Dinner. Reception staff good and arranged taxi's for us. All in all a good hotel choice and would probably stay again.,Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The hotel is located next to the core mall road. Cars do not ply on this road. There is a short but steep walk from the place till where cars are allowed till the hotel entrance. Should not be a problem for anyone other than elderly travelers.  What took my breath away was the huge window in the room. It offers a lovely view of the town as well as the mountain slopes. The room was very cosy and the bathrooms were clean. The bed was equipped with electric blanket and there was a room heater too although we never got to using the latter since it was not too cold.  The room service was very prompt and the quality of the food was decent. I am a bit choosy about my coffee and this place did not disappoint me at all. The dining area too has large windows and you can watch the hills‚Ä¶,Date of stay: April 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
The hotel is in a great position within walking distance of the town but with spectacular views across the mountains. We stayed at the end of March when it was still a bit chilly and I think we would have enjoyed it more later in the year. The staff are very helpful and more than make up for the slightly limited facilities such as a room safe.  The whole of Shimla is on the side of a mountain and there is a stiff walk up hill to get to the hotel from the road. I was greatly impressed with the gentleman who carried our two heavy suitcases on his back up the hill. Well worth a visit.,Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The beds were attached with a heater. Overall the room was really good and the only suggestion i have for them is to provide bathroom slippers because the floor gets really cold during winters. The whole room is carpeted but the pathway which leads to the bathroom is not.

The rooms has amazing view of the hilly terrain and we were lucky enough to get the view of snowfall as well. We loved the hospitality shown by the hotel staff and the breakfast and dinner was awesome. They had plenty of dishes there and the waiters actually keep coming to you for asking if you need anything extra. It was overall amazing.The only disadvantage of the hotel is the climb up the mountain which you have to do by your own as cabs are not allowed.

They sent a person to the start of the climb to carry our baggage. Once we reached our room, I realized that the climb was totally worth it. The view from the huge glass window was breathtaking thanks to the additional height from road.  The hotel is located bang on the mall road, hence most of the tourist attractions are easily accessible.   The room was cozy and well arranged.

Fortunately, when we reached the hotel, we experienced snowfall at around 10 p.m. where we enjoyed in the snow and clicked the best snaps of our lifetime.

The place is quiet and perfect to relax. So far I never heard noises around except for the New Year's eve but that's ok.  We chose the deluxe room to get a different experience of the room compared to honeymoon suite. The view is really nice and the hotel is perfectly like in the pictures. When the hotel car came to pick us up in Mall Road, the ride was almost like ROLLERCOASTER. There are steep ways to walk through to get to the hotel & it's pretty tiring & cold during night.

The room we had was fine,clean and comfortable.In my opinion, the view from the restaurant is quite stunning, the food was very good as well !!! The staff could not do enough for you, nothing was a problem, even down to going into town, and picking up beer for us.As long as you are reasonably fit , it is quite well placed for Simla, if you have walking difficulties, maybe not so. Would I stay there again, yes, without a doubt. A nice comfortable, friendly hotel.",Date of stay: December 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We stayed here for 3 nights in end of Jan 2013. We had taken a Honeymoon Special Room. It was a fantastic room with a warm round bed and a Jhoola.  Food was as per my taste.

Fortunately I didn't have to much luggage as the taxi is not able to drop you near the hotel, as the hotel is located along a NO CAR ZONE, although this is not the Mall proper. (The Mall is still a good 15 min walk from the hotel to the bottom end of the MALL, with more walking up hill). When dropped off by the taxi you are required to walk up the road where there is small lane which is even steeper to the hotel.

After reaching the door of hotel you have to take a lift for 4 floors to reach reception ( It may happen that the lift may be down , we face that situation).  The view from hotel is nice, and heaters in rooms are decent.  Also the hotel do not have parking facility, So you have to park you car somewhere in Parking area (Which is also far from hotel, Also expensive Rs 300/- per day or Each time you park your car whichever is first)  I would like to mention that I was also catered nice Jain Food.

"This was our honeymoon and we had booked this hotel by the name. Thought they will have something special to offer for couples. Indeed it was made special. The room was spacious and comfortable. To make it special they decorate it all over. The hotel is located very near to the Mall, which is an advantage. Though you have to climb up the a little bit to reach the hotel but it is worth walking up. Food in the hotel was good. The view from the hotel was amazing. Staff were very helpful. Did not find anything bad about the hotel. Me and my wife had enjoyed the trip very much and Honeymoon Inn made it more special. On the last day of our stay they offered us a candle light dinner with a Happy Married life cake to be cut.

"The hotel is in a good area & all rooms have valley view. Service is excellent & food is not bad either. However if you expect to get a parking or arrive at the hotel in a car, then you will be disappointed. The hotel is a no vehicle zone & you need to walk (a bit of stepp slope) for about 200 meters & then a few stair to get to a lift that takes you to hotel reception floor. Then again within the hotel there are no lifts to take you to first or 2nf floor.

"Located on Top and away from Market and Mall road , terrible experience had to walk such a long way to reach Mall road and no free or charged service for market drop and pick up even though the Hotel had its own Van facility for personal use.

"The ambiance of the room, the view of the valley, the wood floor and the restaurant were excellent. Kids loved the place. It is on the mall road, the problem is approaching the hotel. Please make sure that you call the reception and ask them the nearest point to get down from the car. Note that the vehicles are not allowed to ply on the road where the hotel is and it is a steep 5-10 minute walk from the nearest drop-off point From that point the hotel was about 15 minute walk over a very steep road. If you have elderly people and kids make sure you ask the hotel reception to help you. When you vacate the hotel you will get porters to carry your luggage till the taxi pick-up point.

Stayed 2 nights at the property in Oct 2013........  Took the MD cottage ( a duplex upscale wooden masterpiece ) where the view was OUT OF THIS WORLD  Breakfast and food was very very good and best part was the service.  The hotel is on the Mall road and is nicely tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Shimla and is an absolute MUST for honeymooners and couples.  The only detrimental fact and there is NOT MUCH that the hotel can do about it is the approach. It is terrible that too being an understatement and is a major hindrance if you are travelling with elderly people like I did....  My special mention here of Simant Malhotra from their Delhi booking office for ensuring EVERYTHING was in place with the hotel and logistics.  Will visit the property definitely some other time,Date of stay: October 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

What stands out in this magnificently conceptualized hotel is its staff that makes you feel at home, such HOSPITALABLE EMPLOYEES, especially those at the buffet table. The location might be a bit stretched out from the mall, but for those desiring to feel at home away from home, this is the place to be. And if you are staying here, it's strictly recommended to HAVE ALL YOUR MEALS AT THE HOTEL itself because they have an EXCELLENT COOK IN THE KITCHEN with a nicely layed out menu....

Our room was spacious, well maintained. hygienic and well furnished with wooden finish. Room service was also good. The bathroom n toilet were clean and toiletries were supplied daily.

We chose this location based mainly on Tripadvisors rating of 4 1/2 but were in for a disappointment when we checked in. To start with the access to the hotel was very surprising. One has to walk about 300 meters to get to the hotel and a taxi or a car is not allowed and there is no space to park also. It is a 10' road access from the dropping point. When we called the hotel on how to get the luggage to the hotel they sent coolies. What surprised us was that we had to pay for the coolie fees as the hotel doesnt pay them.  I was surprised that the hotel doesnt provide the basic facility at their own cost given they dont have an access but the customers have to pay for the service I was disappointed.

"Stayed @ Honeymoon Inn, Shimla from 4th-6th May and the feeling was average. Food was ok, would rate it 3 out of 5. Front desk people seems confused and they don't provide any clarity when a question is asked to them. We took 2 rooms of which 1 room needed to have an extra bed. Instead of providing an extra bed they just provided an extra mattress. This is something which is not expected.  We had booked our vehicle from the hotel and the front desk persons (Mr Sanjay / Zeeshan) couldn't give a proper reply on asking why we were not taken to few places which were mentioned in our itenary. Compared to the Manali Honeymoon Inn this hotel is worthless. Honeymoon Inn @ Manali is far superior compared to this hotel.

"Well I wasn't much impressed with this hotel unlike my experience at Honeymoon Inn, Manali.  Pros: The view is spectacular. Rooms are decent and cleanliness was maintained.   Cons: I got the feeling the working staff were scared of management in front desk. Even for take-away breakfast for kids they looked little scared and asked to check with front desk. The heater is completely useless, what more I can say. It just didn't heat. To get water we had to call 2-3 times only after that job would get done. There is little walk to reach the hotel.

It is definitely the place to go to if you want luxury without making your budget to go haywire. The staff is super friendly, going out of the way to make you comfortable so the unexpected cold of Shimla was beaten by the warmth of the staff.   We reached at 6 in the morning and they could not give us a room before ten thirty but they made  sure our stay was comfortable by providing us with a rug and opening the games room for a few hours to stay.

The approach to hotel has a little drawback as one has to climb 100mts of final stretch as cars not allowed on this road. But don't panic or worry... Hotel manager will arrange for a coolie and ward off your worries. Food is excellent. Hotel contains very good recreation centre that includes well maintained billiards, home theatre, Xbox kinect, carrom, disco. All the staff members are very courteous and you can feel at home.

"The property is pretty decent with clean rooms, great for couples if you wish to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city and want to spend some quality time together. The location is good, right in the middle of the hills. The parking area is a bit far, so you have to walk about 10-12 minutes to reach the hotel. You do get porters to carry your luggage but then going to the Mall and back becomes somewhat of a chore. If you can walk, you can actually reach the mall within 12-15 minutes. The rooms are neat, clean and the food is good. The service is a bit slow as is the case with almost most of the hotels in the hills but you get your food within around 20-30 minutes in your room.",Date of stay: July 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"It's a steep walk up the hill with no access for cars so could be difficult for the elderly or if you have trouble walking.  Porters have to walk up the hill carrying all the luggage and are also not allowed to use the lift (that seems quite cruel) The lift is available part way for hotel guests only.  The rooms were spacious and clean with nice views of the hills.  However, the availability of hot water was a problem - it was limited!!!  So if there are two of you in a room, you have to wait 10-15 mins after the first person has had a shower before the next person can go in!!!  The breakfast was good as was the dinner.

"What no one tells you about Shimla is that no vehicles are allowed within the town unless they have a special pass.  So to get to this Hotel, you are dropped off a mile down the road & attempt to get your bags to the Hotel.  But it doesn't end there, as the Hotel is up a long ramp about 100M from the road up a very steep slope.  So with a heart condition, this is not a good place to stay.

Hotel has got all amenities and the staff (mainly housekeeping and waiters) of the hotel is full of hospitality. There is valley veiw from all super delux rooms.

We had a one night visit to Shimla and chose the Honeymoon Hotel based on the information about its location.  We were not disappointed and the situation of the hotel high up in Shimla gave spectacular views from our room and the restaurant. Service was excellent with the staff being very attentive.

We (with wife and 9 year old son ) stayed for 2 nights. Rooms are clean with adequate facilities. Location of the hotel gives an excellent scenic beauty. Has good view of mountains and landscape. It is on edge of mall road. Flip side of the location is vehicles don't go upto the hotel. Vehicles are prohibted on mall road. Needn't worry as hotel provides service for pick and drop of your luggage. Senior citizens may find it difficult to climb pathway to hotel as path way to hotel is slightly steep. Have an excellent restaurant.

Hotel is very well maintained with prompt service delivery and courteous staff which can be flexible in arranging your meal in their small terrace garden providing excellent view of the valley.

"Positives -  Good size of room  Clean Bathrooms  Good view of shimla valley (looks beautiful at night) Food is good (good quantity) Improvements- Staff should be more courtious  The steep walk from road to hotel ""They dont want you to eat on the bed (& watch TV together) and therefore TV is located off the place towards a sitting area in the room.""   No vehicle (of any type) is allowed inside the mall road of shimla. Therefore to reach to this hotel, one has to walk 10 minutes from Mall road to hotel and then climb (a way of hill) for 2 minutes to reach to hotel lift, therefore it is not adviable for elder people.

"Hello all...recently I had visited the Queen of the hills Shimla. Though the weather was rainy and the clouds hovering in the valley with all the views blocked, I enjoyed the misty atmosphere. When I got out of the train at the Shimla station I had to take cab to drive to the hotel. The hotel is a little off the road and you have to climb a steep gradient for about 2-3 mins to reach the hotel entrance. I was pleasantly surprised to see the hotel lift which took us to the hotel reception. The entire ambiance was wonderful. We got the deluxe room no. 103 and the view of the valley from the wide window was great. we could see the clouds hovering over the valley all day from our room.

The super deluxe rooms are very spacious. The highlights of the place are its decor ( earthy themes) ,food and its proximity to the prestine beach,cleanliness,service and of course the booze collection. Important point to note is that they provided free pick-up/drop which would otherwise have cost us a bomb considering Vasco Railway station is almost a couple of hours' drive away from the resort!

The nearest drop point to hotel is marina hotel's parking from where it is around 100 meters away. Hotel arranges a porter if required. The hotel rooms offer enchanting views of the valley and it was a pleasure watching the clouds hovering below the hotel.

Restaurant though small, served some decent food - the dinner buffer is good value. Breakfast is modest but sufficient.  No complaints. The only reason I haven't given this place 5 stars in the climb up to get to this place.

We were there in February so it was still chilly and there was snow on the ground in shadey places.

We reached there at 10.30 pm & were welcomed by very helpful management team. They arranged for our dinner at 11 pm though it was very late for them. The rooms are very cozy & clean. The heater provided is also of good quality unlike other hotels.  Food is also one of the plus points of this hotel. The complementary breakfast which they provide also has a very good variety & a great taste.

You can also see the Christ Church from some of the rooms in the hotel..   Food: Food was average, with the breakfast spread being fairly limited. Also did not find the food particularly tasty or unique.  Service and Hospitality: Though the service was ok, we did find that at times there were delays.

"Its a nice hotel located at a picturesque location. The approach is little steep but its the case for most of the places in Shimla, so if you're ready to huff n' puff d first few steps, the hotel itself is very good. Its the best at that price bracket. All the rooms are neat and clean, well furnished and comfortable. A tad luxurious if u compare with the other hotels charging the same. The staff are friendly and courteous, will make arrangements for sight-seeing too. Just bear in mind the hotel is a bit far from the mall road( a pleasant walk if u're young) and very far from the bus stand so its advisable to take a taxi(Rs 150-250).",Date of stay: February 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"As others have commented, the view from this place is stunning.  However, it's at the far end of the mall away from most of the action.  So be prepared for lots of hilly walking. If you speak the local language, this place is probably great.  As we did not, it was very difficult to communicate with the hotel staff.  For example, no one at the front desk could understand our request to have a working light in the bathroom.  We had to remove the bulb and coax someone into the room before they understood the issue.  Even then, they still didn't fix the problem (I think it was a problem with the outlet vs. the bulb), but we were too frustrated to pursue it further.  No one could give us simple directions to things like the main bus station, even with the use of a map!  And don't‚Ä¶",Date of stay: August 2011,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The hotel is small but beautiful and such is the location that you want to come back to hotel to enjoy the place rather than going around Shimla.

The rooms are similar in design to the ones we stayed in at Manali (mirrors on the walls and ceiling!). The Hotel is located right on top of the hill on Mall road. Reaching there is one of the most challenging tasks. We were travellling by road and the car could be only taken upto the High court end of Mall road (The Mall road in Shimla has 'Restricted' entry for Vehicles). The hotel is then a 1 km walk uphill. We were breathless on reaching the hotel after an almost 10-15 min walk. You will find coolies who would be willing to help you with your luggage from the High court end to the hotel for Rs. 50-60.

The manager upgraded our Deluxe room  to Honeymoon Suite at a very reasonable price. The complimentary breakfast was good too. And the food from the√≠r restaurant was very tasty.

Stayed in this hotel at the end of October 2010 during me and my wife's 6 week trip around India. Having hated the hustle and bustle of New Delhi this was a truly delightful respite from the noise and smog of city life in the plains of New Delhi. We arrived into Shimla via the Toy Train from Kalka (which I would highly recommend for the wonderful views and to appreciate the engineering marvel of the train journey high up into the mountains) at around 5pm just as it was getting dark and decided to walk the journey with our backpacks from Shimla train station to the hotel. It may be wise to take a taxi as this ended up being quite a walk as the hotel is located at the far end of Mall Road up a very steep hill from the train station and through the centre of Shimla.

"After being introduced to India in Delhi, it was wonderful to escape to this charming mountain town and equally charming hotel.  The hotel was great, with the only negative thing is the very steep hill one has to climb to get there.  But they had warned us in advance about it.... still, it was steep!  So if you're older, unless you're in good shape, I probably wouldn't recommend it.  But the location is fine.... relatively easy to walk into town and back so no taxis are needed.  We took the room/meal/tour package and aI guess that idea is OK.  The food was quite good, and the tour was good although limited to just two sites.  But we probably could have ordered it all on our own and paid separately for the things, and it probably would have been cheaper. But still, it was OK.

The cab drops you at a point which is around 200 meters from the hotel. The remaining distance is a bit uphill but quite manageable.

"I hate starting a review with ""If only....."" but Honeymoon Inn, shimla is so perfect in all other aspects that it leaves one no choice. If only the management provides the facilites for picking up their guests when they arrive, it would make for a perfect stay. The problem is also partly an asset - its location just off the entrance of the famous Mall Road. Hence, tourist cars are not allowed upto to the road leading to the hotel. We were directed by the hotel front desk to stop our taxi at the highcourt parking stand, haggle with the porters and then walk with the porters lugging your bags upto the hotel which is a fairly strenuous walk, and not something one looks forward to after travelling for 6 hours as we had done.

After all what you get after that is worth every step you have walked... Managers are very helpful...

And to most of it the help desk at hotel really guided us to the best places to see with their even full support on phone. They have great service for honeymoon couples but a great arrangement for families too and all that at very reasonable price.  So just stay with complete peace in this hotel",Date of stay: June 2007,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

It's really an excellent hotel with tasty food and prompt service ..over all value for money.. Its a little bit expensive but  loved it.  Its location is a bit odd because its on the top of the hill and car will leave you quit far from the hotel . You will have to walk up to reach the hotel .

Only the approach road to the hotel is very stiff for aged person which will create difficulty. But for the young age couple and family it will be a really excellent place to stay.

For honeymoon visitor, feel completely secured.  some negatives:  Hotel would generally offer you a half day site-seeing in a package which they will try to convert into full day site seeing with extra cost. This extra cost itself is enough to have full day site-seeing with outside agent.  So dont opt for site-seeing in the initial offer or stick to whatever is offered.

It is just a ten minute walk from the famous Oberoi Clarkes Hotel. For those driving to Shimla,  you can find ample parking at the High Court Parking lot.  The hotel is set amongst pine trees and is at the top of a hill thus giving a great view. The staff are very efficient and we very pleased with the service.

The reservation staff of the hotel dont even bother to have a follow up with the guest nor they check from which person the amount has been credited ....

The desk staff was really courteous and the room had a wonderful view of the valley. The hotel is situated on the far end of the mall road and a stroll from the Hotel takes you to the Ridge on the mall road.

I stayed at this hotel in June 2009 with my husband and liked this place a lot. This hotel lives up to its name and is truly a great place for honeymooners. The rooms offer a great view of the Shimla Valley and are very comfortable. The hotel has a very well maintained garden and a sitting area where one can sit and enjoy the sun. They have these concealed speakers installed around the place where light music is played throughout the day. One of the major negatives of the hotel is the approach to the main gate which is a very steep climb and has to be done on foot which is very tiring.

Please make sure that you call the reception and ask them the nearest point to get down from the taxi. Note that the taxis are not allowed to ply on the road where the hotel is and it is a steep 5-10 minute walk from the nearest drop-off point. I took taxi from the railway station to the hotel and the taxi fellow lied to me saying that they are not allowed to go any further.

It was around Rs 2700 a night, AND you have to pay extra to use the computer AND for tea AND for coffee AND im sure everything else you wanted as well. This staff was not very friendly and they dont even speak English. The front desk guy litteraly hunted me down to pay the Rs 30 for my tea in which they brought to my room making me think it was free. Btw, dont tip the bellhops. The rooms are way outdated and really tacky with mirrors on the ceiling.

Toilet seat accessories were loose and half broken and dirty. Wardrobe looked like cheap hotels.  Views from premium rooms can be stunning because it is on the ridge and is higher than the mall.

Quality of food was awesome with reasonable prices and the restaurant staffs were really impressive. The hotel is situated 200 m above the Mall Road.

"The hotel building belongs to the family of former CM of the state who themselves resides next to it. It is also close to DC residence. This gives  the hotel a premier  location and to my understanding should be set as GPS location to reach the hotel property.  It is also be reached by foot from mall road, the route is about 300 mts of mild height . That's ok for a place like shimla which is of course a hill station. Yes, any one with walking disability should avoid stay in this property . For others, a good buy of wooden stick from lakkar  bazaar can be a support and advisable also.  Hotel is good for a short stay only. Being a old building is fairly reflected in its ambiance.

Shimla is very expensive in food and transport.  Mr. Rakesh and Mr. Naresh helped us very much during our stay. The response from the room service was good and we could get the food prepared and delivered at 10 pm as well.  It would be good if they can have separate non-smoking rooms.,Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Summit LeRoyale is located very close to the Ridge.. the rooms are pretty decent and good enough space... the only concern is the steep up hill walk from the Ridge to the hotel... it's tiring if you are not used to walking in hills... unfortunately the roads from the Ridge to the hotel are no vehicle zone.. so you have no choice but to walk... views from the hotel are good...but there is no lift in hotel... for views you will have to go on higher floors... beware of the monkeys outside the hotel area... usually the hotel warns you to keep the windows also closed... overall a nice experience... hotel staff is very friendly..,Date of stay: January 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Had visited on 9th Oct . Although room was ok but the staff was pathetic .Food menu was limited and way overpriced like (rs 140 for 2 boiled eggs ). Food quality was average . The manager at reception did not even bother to greet us checking in or checking out .  Omelette was too much oily. the way to reach there was very tough .I asked a glass of Milk for kid it was water 50 percent . Please find better hotels these work as a  Nexus with online booKing . Please avoid staying here . It's not worth it .,Date of stay: October 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

The rate is also not too high and complete value for money.  Also would like to mention about the great service provided by Mr Chamel Singh Negi, the FO Manager.

The hotel is situated at a steep height but it is very much in vicinity of the mall road. Also, the famous lakkar bazaar, ridge, is just a minute's walk from this hotel.  I definitely recommend this hotel. But if you plan on staying with aged people, then the steep slopes can be troublesome and exhausting.

First thing to point out - this place is a nightmare to get to by car!  Good things:  1. Close to Mall Road area 2. Breakfast reasonable (limited choice but good quality) 3. Efficient room service and reasonable prices of food for dinner  Bad things: 1. A hotel with Spa in the name has no spa - this is surely mis-selling and should be changed immediately. The manager agreed he had no spa but seemed least bothered by this! 2. Getting there is a nightmare by car (for the second time) - it took over 45 mins of driving around and stopping at many places to get help to reach. The only phone number we had was for reservations and they rarely answer the phone (and not at all when we were trying while having difficulty finding the place). 3. Do not book a family room - they look nice in‚Ä¶,Date of stay: July 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Our room was a family room, it was December and the room did not even have proper heating, we literally froze inside, just a small movable heater. Our limbs were numb inside the room. It looked so old and dirty everything was just like medieval times, not even renovated. We left the hotel the same night within an hour and moved to another decent place.

Summit Le Royale An extremely cosy hotel around 800 mtrs from Shimla Mall road. We were there for a single night and did have a pleasant experience. The hotel is quite old but maintained extremely well. The room had heater which was extremely necessary. Food was also quite tasty and the menu was varied.  Breakfast was simple with multiple options.  The only drawback was the approach road for cars....it was too narrow...though that is not something where the hotel management can do anything. Overall a cosy and beautiful stay !!,Date of stay: December 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

USP or Uniqueness of this Hotel is you are already above Mall road, on the back side of Christ Church, you can actually skip all the crowd, skip 2 govt lifts to climb from down to Mall road and actually save lot of time reaching to the Mall..  The only comparable property is Marina is is 4 time expensive than this property. Rest all big hotels like Honeymoon inn or Willowbank doesn't have parking or road access.

"Whenever we travel to any hill station, the first thing we look out for is that it should offer a good view,summit le Royale will never disappoint you on that note!  Note:A word of caution though,the hotel is located at quite a height and the roads are very steep, so be ready for a good climb and if you are with elderly people, kindly take a cab which will cost you between 600-700 from the bus station.  Nestled in the lap of mountains,this place offers the perfect bird eye view of the entire city. The best part is that it's really close to the main attraction points such as the church and the ridge area,also it comes in the mid while you are heading towards the famous jakoo temple.

"Its a decent hotel but is situated far somewhat far from city center.  If you are coming on a car, it is about 15 minutes drive from the city center. There is a short cut to mall road ( city center) if you decide to walk down from hotel but you need to have stamina to climb the steep roads. So if you have knee pain issues, avoid this at all cost. Otherwise hotel is quite decent, well maintained. Though you can get a feel that it is aged! Staff is courteous.

For young and aged people it is not recommended, however, we took it up positively and as a fitness test for as long as we stayed.  Coming to best part- the staff !

"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone or any age. Here are the reason  1. This hotel is very steep. You need to think before you go and come to the hotel because of its height. If you are having kids or elder people. DO NOT TAKE THIS HOTEL. Even young people get tired to reach to hotel. You cannot frequently go and back to this hotel. 2. At this price, you would get better hotel compared to this. They charged much and after paying that amount you are not getting much. Again too much steep. Also, Rooms in the pictures and actual is a totally different thing. Pictures look like amazing but actually is not good. Thumbs down to for the room.

"For all first timers to Shimla, I will give you golden advise. If you have light luggage and can walk uphill for over 700 - 800m, you are good to go. If you have luggage and you need to get to this place by a car / taxi, please do not attempt going to this place. It is a very dangerous route that is additional 6-7 kms since you have to travel slightly off route. No taxi is willing to take you there, and unless the taxi wala is a local, he wont be equipped to drive in those crazy narrow lanes and they will only end up getting harassed by the locals. And anywhere you go, you have to plan at min 20 min walk before you get access to either the lift or a vehicle. The mall road is very close about 10 mins walk.  Now the hotel - Extremely unclean. Too much dust and too many insects.‚Ä¶",Date of stay: April 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

We booked our stay during July after seeing good pictures of the hotel. But the biggest problem was the location. Extremely steep and narrow road will lead you to the hotel. I saw some reviews mention this but I thought it would be manageable. But the road is not convenient for big cars. Plus there is no parking. Only expert drivers can manage it I feel. And the rooms were decent but not very well maintained. One of the furniture pieces in our room was broken.  The front desk and staff were supportive. No complaints there.

Location:- location wise hotel is very strategically located in terms of visiting all the famous spots like Ridge, Jakhu temple, Lakkar bazar and mall road etc. One can enjoy the late evening walk to The Ridge as it is just 8 min walk from hotel. On first day we found the steep walk difficult but later we got acclimatized. HOWEVER, NOT a good location for older people. I also suggest to park the vehicle at public parking near ""the lift"".

"The Hotel is perched above Mall Road and behind the Church on Jakhoo Road. The crow flight distance to the railway station is just 2 kms. However, the road where it is located is inaccessible by cabs until 7 in the evening and the actual distance is about 9 kms. The room offers a view of the entire Shimla city and is peaceful. Good for a stroll to and from Mall Road if you are fit to conquer the steep hills of Shimla. Getting there with luggage and without a car would be a misadventure. The room had a slightly old fashioned look which is typical of hill stations. The heater seemed weak but kept the room warm enough for an uninterrupted sleep in near 0 degree temperatures.

We had to complain and the attendant came to explain. Also the health faucet near the commode is fixed on the wrong side- it is on the left whereas it should have been fixed on the right side.

Restaurant is nice and specially Chinese food is awesome!..Breakfast was good but taste can be better!  Front desk is supportive and attend most of your queries. Support staff is also good. Enjoyed 2 days stay here between 28th to 2nd Mar 2017. I will definitely recommend this hotel for pleasant stay.,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Don't stay this hotel from December to January. I choose this property via MMT & stayed with my family from 16th January 2017 till 18th January 2017 for two nights. we arrived in evening from New Delhi by road for sure tired with two kids. when we reached our driver inform us that we have to walk till hotel from Shimla bus station. I called hotel desk to provide the 4X4 vehicle to reach but the person was unable to provide. we walk almost 45 minutes with full of pain like this was a punishment not a holiday. we stayed 2 days and nights just in room due to no vehicle facility available in this hotel. over all this hotel is not for family. bad .........bad ..........bad.,Date of stay: January 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Hotel is descent with average room conditions..we got the room was full of moisturized walls.. food is good in the hotel.. one important thing ..the hotel is at a big height(serious slant road) and taxis will charge a lot to drop you there and take lot of time to reach from bus stand or town..if you can climb then its fine.. i will not suggest it for aged people or families(having children) though the service was very good and staff is really very helpful..,Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Property doesn‚Äôt fulfil criteria for a four star one. Reaching to the hotel is a task though they have their own parking. Views from the rooms are good but not awesome. Hell lot of improvement is required in room maintenance. However, food tasted good. House-keeping staff was well supportive. Availability of water at all times can be an issue. Found it expensive as per the room & services received. Guest relationship team seems to be quite active as gave my feedback during check-out and received call from them after few days. They apologized for unsatisfactory experience and assured better services in future.",Date of stay: January 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
We had wonderful a stay at Summit Le Royale for 2nights. The interior and facilities at top floor was unique and we just loved it. It is close to Mall road but due to one way traffic we had difficulties approaching this hotel. The foods in breakfast and dinner was very tasty. But just one suggestion a bit more variety in menu would be an ice on the cake.,Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Visited the hotel on 1st week of Jan'17, the approaching road to the hotel is very narrow and steep, the rooms are ok but services and food is pathetic, they mentioned that they have power back which is totally fake they have a UPS only n that is for reception, we stayed without electricity for 2 days from 6-8 January and faced horrible time of my life just because of the Le royal poor managment, my booking was for 4 days and I left hotel after 2 days. never recommend to anyone.",Date of stay: January 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"Average hotel, good staff. Ok stay. Nothing specific or memorable about the hotel to mention. Was there with my husband & toddler for 1 night stay. It's close to the mall road. The hotel is situated at a hill top. As it was super cold when we visited, the heater was very essential which was provided on request without any charges(other hotels charge for the same) but the standing heater was of little use in the freezing cold. Ample blankets were provided which was very useful.",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
it was a great stay and breakfast was also good. We stayed for a night and rooms were spacious. only cons was that you have to go by foot to a height and so ypu should hire a coolie to take your luggage and rest of the family will come by lift,Date of stay: January 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Visited this hotel on the first week of December 2016. First of all the vehicle doesn't drive till the hotel. Reaching the hotel is a trekking on its own. If you are lucky enough you will get a coolie, but need to negotiate with him. Until you reach the hotel your holiday mood is gone for a toss.  We had to check out from the hotel at 6 in the mrng. The person at the front desk had no info on how to book a cab or how to proceed to a check out. We were late by an hour and a half until we reached our cab.   Bed was not tidy when we checked in. Had to call housekeeping to get it cleaned.  Average food and staff is not friendly.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
"Overwhelming reception when we reached the hotel. Our car we parked at the parking lot and I headed into the room. The beautiful sun rays of the afternoon beautiful sunset penetrated into the room literally reminded me of HIS creation. Overlooking the green foliage and the mountain's horizon from the big glazed glass window of our hotel room I could also see some interesting exclusive species like monkeys and orangutans. The specious room had beautiful curtain, gud tasteful decor and the bathroom was more spacious then expected. The staff are so friendly they can go to any extent to help you. I have stayed many times in this hotel as my son studies here and I shall stay further when I visit Shimla at Le Royale.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
This hotel is located right at the heart of The Mall and Lakkar Bazar. These 2 places are within walking distance. One can view ChristChurch from the hotel room. Rooms are clean  and cozy. Food is good. Hotel staffs are friendly and accomodating. The only drawback is the road leading to the hotel.. its a treacherous journey but its an adventure. The hotel and the surrounding scenery makes up for it. Beauty of Shimla and its mountains are breathtaking.,Date of stay: November 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Very nice hotel to stay at Shimla , it is very near by to jhakoo temple which should not be missed to visit and also with Mall Road appx. 5 minutes  walk in distance. One suggestion to avoid self drive if not trained well for hill stations. Hotel is having very nice view from rooms with all modern facilities and amenities. Staff were so courteous and always shown warm gesture towards guest. I would definitely recommenced  this property to everybody. I stayed in 301 & 304 both rooms were so cleaned .  We made the booking through online with best rates.Buffet breakfast spread was very good with different menu options.  Once again thank you so much Hotel Team to make my family stay memorable.  You guys are rock on!!!!!!!",Date of stay: November 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"I had read some negative reviews from trip advisor and other such sites about this hotel. i had booked an air india package covering simla and manali. Air india had given me no other choice. so i was forced to stay in this hotel. As one of the traveller has reviewed three days back i was given one room at the top floor and they were explaining that the room is of higher cost, but because of shortage in rooms they have given a higher class room to me.Any one staying in the room cannot walk with out bending through the room. after complaining they agreed to change the room on the second day. The location of this hotel is also not so great and the parking area is a night mare for drivers. I asked my driver to take dinner from the hotel as he could not find any nearby hotels. i‚Ä¶",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
"I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2016. I booked family suit. It was like a ghost house..! Very conjusted. The roof height is very low. Two persons can hardly walk freely without enjuring one's head. Moreover a lot of monkeys are around over there. And when they jump over the tin roof, it makes horrible sound..! Unfortunately it was heavily raining on that night with a lot of wind, adding some more terrible sounds..! It was really a nightmare for us..! On multiple requests for change in the room, we were given it on the last night as if it was a great mercy to us.! Many facilities like pool, lift, spa appearing on their website are actually not there..! Staff was rude. I was required to call their Siligudi head-office for each small thing.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

"We stayed there during the month of July. I must say the place is quite peaceful and the buffet breakfast is nice too. Spacious rooms with almost all facilities. The only problem is that if you do not have a car, walking to the property might be tiring. Otherwise the location is just perfect- near Mall road and lift PS: I would have given 5 stars if t were not for the location",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Hotel Le royale is literally 5 min walk from the ridge, rooms are spacious, staff is friendly and helpful, breakfast can be improved, if u r getting there in ur own car then its a mission getting to the hotel but the manager organizes a staff member waiting for u near the lift which will guide u to a back road leading u to the hotel basement carpark. Mind u half a mile before u reach the hotel the road is really tight but manageable. Overall a pleasant stay. Thx.",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"On the positive side, this hotel is very close to the Mall, the centre of Shimla city. It is only a 5 mins walk to the Church, but on your way back the road is steep and you may need to take a few pause during the short walk.  The portal that I used to book this hotel mentioned this hotel as a 4 star property, but I do not believe the facilities provided are matching anyway near that. Let me clarify that, my expectation probably was a bit high, but the facilities are not bad, and I would compare that to a 3 star property (my personal opinion)  They have a good restaurant and the daily breakfast was good.   If you are driving yourself, please avoid this place! In my case I was driving a low floor sedan, and had a horrible time reaching there.. most of the better roads shown in‚Ä¶",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"The location is Good,  Close to the mall road, but the climb back to the Hotel is vey steep, but a good experience for the people  from the planes.  The rooms  are spacious. But keep the windows closed  as Monkeys are always in the prowl.  The employees are courteous.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Location is good but troubling. It is difficult to reach hotel if self driving. Expert driving skills required to reach hotel as road is extremely steep and narrow. 5 minutes walking diatance from church but that too very steep. Not suitable if you r travelling with kids and elders.  Hotel room is neat and clean. Rooms r spacious and cozy. Do not book deluxe rooms go for super delux. Breakfast was worst part of the stay. Linited choice with poor taste. Food is very costly.,Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Before anything else, let's jump to pros and cons of the hotel..-  Pros:  1.Very close to the ridge/Chris church (5 mins steep walk), Jakhu mandir (30-45mins steep walk) 2.Excellent view from the rooms.(I stayed in room 201. There are couple of bad reviews of this hotel in tripadvisor but I think if one can ask or get rooms 201/301/401 then it would be really good.) 3.You earn the bragging right of being neighbor to CM's house (present CM's residence Holly Lodge is 5 mins steep walk from the hotel) 4.Courteous staff , good breakfast.  Cons:  1. Direct booking of this hotel is costlier but if you go through goibibo deals then you might land with good deals. In my case, direct booking costs 4K, however goibibo gave deals of 2.4K with complementary breakfast. 2.Being close to Jakhu‚Ä¶",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"The location of the hotel is fantastic. As you walk down, you will find the famous church and the Ridge. The only thing which I didn't like much is you cannot open the windows in the room as its all surrounded by monkeys, as its near Jhaku temple. So no fresh air in the room. We had booked 3 rooms, only one room had the perfect view from the window. Rest the room us clean, the location is amazing.

I had visited Shimla on the 12th May with my family. I decided to stay in hotel Summit Le Royale as I am a Summit Select Member. As our car enter the car park of the hotel the bell boy ushered us till the reception and we were welcomed by Mr. Sushil the GM of the hotel. This warm welcome with a hot cup of tea & scarf made us feel at home. Gradually we climbed up to the hotel room 303. We became more happy to gaze upon the far hills and the Mall right below the hotel. The walking distance to the mall was the major attraction to be in this hotel. My wife and my son was very happy to laze out under the afternoon son looking upon the horizon of the hills from the windows. I will definitely stay if I go back again to Shimla.,Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
