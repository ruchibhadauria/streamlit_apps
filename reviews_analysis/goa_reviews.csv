"For me one of the advantages of this resort is that it gives you access to sparsely crowded strip of a clean beach and also a close access to the city. If one likes to walk then the city market is I think around three kilometers away. We had a bay view room , specious and comfortable. We relaxed to the lapping sound of waves in the afternoon and in the night. Did not have meals in their restaurants but the breakfasts were good and catring to vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians with ample choice. The hotel has Gem in GBC (Goa Baking Company) the hotel Patisserie, manned by very efficient young and smiling excellent servers. I did not note their names, my apologies. The names which however I remember for their excellent service and functional skills are Pranali - Front Office, Shruti (makes mean cocktails) - AZUR, Sadika - House Keeping and Delana -  giving a different dimension to F & B Service. This was our second stay at this hotel. Always worth a visit and off course stay.. The hotel staff in every department makes the stay special. Thank you for  a wonderful stay.…",Date of stay: December 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Greetings  I went for a brunch to the Waterfront restaurant at Marriott Goa . I am extremely dissatisfied with the absence of plant based, Vegan options at the brunch.   For a hotel of the supposed calibre of Marriott, the inability to keep up with the changing scenario wherein the world is rapidly embracing a plant based diet and the larger Vegan Ethic for ethical, environmental and health reasons even in hardcore meat eating cultures is extremely disappointing. Even in the traditional Indian food which has innumerable plant based,vegan by default dishes, the addition of dairy butter, ghee is absolutely unnecessary.   And it's surprising that your hotel is unaware of the global scenario wherein plant based, Vegan alternatives to meat and dairy are taking the world by storm. …",Date of stay: December 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Also want to give a big shoutout to Delana. Gave us the room at around 2:30 pm even though the checkin time was 4 pm which was very much appreciated. The room was lovely with an awesome view of the sea from the sit-out . The washroom was ok with a very small bathtub. We booked breakfast and dinner in the package which was served as a buffet at the waterfront restaurant by the pool side. I personally didn't find it any special with very few options.

Next time they said they have batter but it'll take a long time to switch on tawa so they can't make it. I asked for toasted bread they said I have to buy it from bakery and keep it in room and even then they won't toast it. For each and every request they'll say no. Both the days we stayed there was wedding going on right in front of the sea facing rooms so the loud music made our stay even harder.

"Marriott resorts Goa is the First property of Marriott India and must say they have done the property quite well. Its located right on the Miramar beach and has an excellent view of the beach from the rooms and reception. Well, for any stay to be successful and a happy one, it's not just the beauty of the property that would suffice, it's also the service which plays a key role. And their hospitality is commendable, be it at receiving guests or giving surprises to guests on special days, just like we got our room upgraded for free, despite being fully packed, just because it was our anniversary. Special thanks to Sumati Dhar who ensured our stay to be smooth and filled with surprises 🙂 And about the food, their buffet spread is huge and everyone has something to their liking 😋…",Date of stay: December 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Additionally, there are serious internet connectivity problems.  Expect web access to be so slow that it's nearly useless.  The phone in our room was very outdated.

Plus, you will not be able to get a view of the sea as its blocked by trees that side.  The service at the Hotel was excellent! The restaurant, pool bar and the in room dining were well managed.

This is a over rated property. Very old property more than 20 years old. I really don't know what other guests who have rated 5 have seen in this resort and how many 5 Star resorts they have seen before.   There is no beach where you can take a walk. Pool is mini pool of 4.5 ft depth. Food and service is one area where this property is comparable with other properties of this standard. Very  conjested rooms. Highly over priced.  They pay very less salary to front line staff and still they work with lots of dedication.  .my suggestion is avoid this. You have much better properties in goa at half price,Date of stay: October 2021,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The service blew our minds away - the best we have seen in the industry and clearly did not expect this high one from Marriott@Goa.

"Being regulars at the Goa Marriott - we have been staying there with family every year since 2012, our 5 nights and 6 days this August was easily the most memorable and the best so far at the Bay View Suite on the 3rd level.

And, though we visited in the midst of a cool monsoon season, the warmth at the hotel was indeed palpable – you could almost see the joyous smiles behind the masks of all the staff that welcomed us after a year.

Well, the buffet at Waterfront was very interesting with many more dishes then before. The snacks counter waz good and my grandkids enjoyed. The pork dish was well cooked and tasty too.

The staff were very meticulous especially Pranali at front desk, we could see her for help almost everywhere,  in the restaurant, outside our room and poolside. Even the massage was great especially by Ugyen and haircut by Sandeep. Would have loved more of the spa services and beach access but unfortunately was limited due to rains and Covid.

The pre check-in communication was excellent and the check in formalities were done in quick time. We booked the deluxe King room with Patio as it had access to garden- much needed if you have pet along. Lockdown was in place so there wasn't much to do outside the resort.

Durlove became almost like a personal butler to myself and colleagues but never failed to deliver. Nothing was too much trouble day or night and he is a credit to his position within the hotel. The rest of the staff that all spent five months in a secure bubble went above and beyond the call of duty in such difficult times, from servicing the rooms to serving food.

"The hotel is located on Miramar Beach and has large, well appointed rooms. Beware of insects in the room, as there may be quite a few.   The hotel falls flat in service, especially in their restaurants. I stayed here when I took my 11 month old daughter for her first vacation and it was a forgettable experience.

"Goa Marriott has exceptional service, beautifully-appointed rooms, delicious food at the buffet (we sampled all meals there) and kind and courteous staff who try to accommodate reasonable requests. One disappointment was that they seem to have reduced their pool-size from infinity pool to a regular, somewhat smaller pool. The Sunday Lunch buffet along with the local musicians (AJ's father-son duo) were a delight. And so were Mario and Darren with their Goan songs who used to entertain the guests at the restaurants during breakfast. Covid protocal demanded that the guests attend the pool after pre-booking the slots. Which served everyone well considering there was no over-crowding.

The breakfast buffet was vast and approachable for westerners and included a personal visit from the Chef.  They have multiple restaurants for dinner which offer both Goan cuisine and other, (Asian, Italian, etc) for variety.

"I booked this hotel because I trust the Marriott name. When we arrived I could not believe what I saw. The pictures of the resort on Marriott‘s website must have been extremely altered using photoshop. The hotel is 20 years old, the hallways are dirty with stained carpets,the rooms are small and dirty and the „beach“ is a bad smelling dark garbage dump, you can’t and should not go into the water as garbage is flooding down the river. The pool is tiny. The hotel is hosting lots of weddings during wedding season which  means more people than the hotel can actually handle. The prices they charge for what you get are ridiculous.  Having gone through this experience I call this a complete scam.

Over the next few days we worked with Parnay to understand the position of our bags.  We were greeted by Delana – what a wonderful, personal individual she is.

We (2 adults 1 child) were allotted an (non requested) accessible room (though upgraded to the next level) which had handicapped bathroom with rusty fittings.Many requests later we were alloted in the 'upgraded' wing a smaller but similar category room.

I have stayed in other Marriots but since this is a resort,it definitely is not like the other properties they own. We were given a garden facing room with a patio for sitting out and the room was also good. The swimming pool was too small but the poolside bar was a thumbs up.

I loved the open lobby area which had a view so breath taking as it over looked the sea! The check in was very smooth as well.   Coming to the room, it was spacious with a gorgeous sea view!   It being my husbands birthday, the staff presented me with one of their finest cake ever!   They have a great variety of cuisines to choose from as well - Indian, International styled buffets and Pan Indian!   You can easily hire a scooty or taxi outside the hotel in the budget of your choice!   The staff here is extremely polite, co-operative and well mannered!   If you too are looking at a 5 star treatment in South Goa, I would highly recommend them!",Date of stay: October 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Situated in the prime location of Miramar and with a stunning view of river Mondovi and the famous Miramar beach, the hotel has a view that is hard to take eyes off of. The lush green nature full of palm trees adds to the exotic experience and makes the place delightfully breezy. The hotel has 3 restaurants, one of which is open air and surrounding a swimming pool. The food is delicious and there is a variety of Indian as well as international cuisines. A special mention to the staff that is readily available for your service all the time. Overall I had a wonderful experience. 10/10 recommend.",Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Stayed at the Marriott for two nights. As a gold elite I was upgraded to a bay view patio room.  The facilities and breakfast were on point, as were all the staff. I made ample use of their excellent spa and massage therapists.  Our ashtanga class with Jees was the best.  My only gripe is that they booked us in a sea view room whose view was blocked by wedding festivities for a whole day, and we weren’t informed about this until the night before.",Date of stay: December 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"This resort is the perfect choice for Goa.  It gives you everything you need from a big business hotel and everything you'd want from a small boutique-type guesthouse.  The facilities are grand and ideally located within walking distance of several excellent restaurants. The party scene is close enough to visit, but not so close that it keeps you awake at night.  Food is available 24 hours a day, check-in is friendly and efficient, and the internet is strong throughout the facilities.  At the same time, you get very warm, personalized service.  Upon hearing we had a difficult trip in, Hazel immediately ran to get us a couple of cold beers to sip on while we completed the check-in process.

"During our first week at the resort, there were heavy rains followed by a cyclone.  Following the storms, the only pool at the resort was shut down for a few days because of all the debris.  The good thing is that they tried accommodating people by shuttling them to another nearby resort in order to compensate them for not being able to swim. The hotel is a little older and the set-up is a little out of date but it is however a nice and clean place.  The rooms are clean, the WiFi is great throughout the resort and the all-you-can-eat buffet is very varied and tasty.  The one thing that stood out the most is the friendly service and the very approachable staff.

"This place is rated 4 star but some bits are better than that.  The strongest asset is the staff.  Since only about 10% of occupents were European, we might well have been ignored and obliged to eat Indian food only.  However, we were immediately ""taken in hand "" by  the restaurant staff who explained that we could order from a separate menu at both lunch and dinner.  The head chef spent time talking to us and making sure that what we wanted was what we got.  Sadly, the sea was too dangerous for us to swim there; red flags all the time.  Neighbouring beach-side restaurants were lovely and in fact the entire length of the South Goa beach is idylic and unspoiled by excessive tourism and large hotels.  Hotel and pool were spotless.  Well done Baywatch and all its staff.",Date of stay: November 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Visit Marriott Goa almost every year for Film Bazaar and just love the location.  Overall most of the staff and facilities are great but there is always something missing.  It seems the current GM does take their work seriously and takes the day off on the Sunday when several hundred delegates from around the world on the premises.  One should not need to lecture the staff in the kitchen.  Any five star hotel in India these days clearly marks the dishes vegetarian or non vegetarian.  Just putting tiny spots helps one one.  Hopefully soon Five star hotels in India will also mark gluten free items as well.  Was disappointed once again with the state sponsored lunches.

This was meant to be a family and friends vacation and turned out to be a total disappointment.   To begin the family suite are not family suites and do not have room for more than 2 people.

We were greeted by some of the most courteous staff members who let us into a hassle free check-in ( not to forget our no request made - upgrade to bay facing room). I would specifically mention Chef Souvik who was so kind to us. During buffet he made special dish for us not one but 2-3 occassions (a mix sauce pasta, veg Xacuti, etc.). Rooms, service was great - however, while I was at the airport, I looked back and realized that what stood was that I didn't miss…",Date of stay: October 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Spent two days at the  Hotel. Superbly located and beautifully crafted place with a lovely view from the lobby.  The Front Office was very helpful. A few suggestions: My room was on the fourth floor. And I got lost twice as there is no proper signage to reach the lift. The lift is not in the lobby, so one tends to get lost . As you come down to the lobby, the signage doesn't say that -- this is your way to the Lobby. Also when the lift stops at the second or fourth floor, the wall should mention the floor. I used the toiled on the lobby level but it was stinking heavily and was nauseating,   The housekeeping said they had sprinkled some insecticide etc. The lobby is very sultry, so suggest you install fans/aircoolers etc. Otherwise.....a nice hotel",Date of stay: October 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Our room was spacious, clean, with a lovely sea view. The pool area was clean, with plenty of staff to assist you.  We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel every night.  The chef's were highly visible and cooked meals for those guests who had special dietary needs.  I would like to recognise Kalyan our Pastry Chef who went over and above his role on customer relations.  Plenty of choice for Indian and International dishes, particularly for myself who cannot eat spicy food.  All of the staff were very accommodating.

We had a guest and her husband stay at the Marriott Resort and Spa for 10 days. The guest is a professional athlete and had strict dietary requirements.   The staff at the hotel - especially Shubham and Chef Gaurav went out of their way to cater to the athlete’s specific needs and at different hours to their meal timings.   We also used the banquet halls for press conferences which were again made available at short notice due to the excellent customer service by Shailendra.   Delilah made sure the guests were always comfortable with their room and other amenities.   Again a big thanks to the staff of the Marriott Resort and Spa!

"This was a nice hotel, but a couple of things took the sparkle off it.   To start with the positives, the room was lovely and the food was amazing.  I literally can't fault the food.  Huge selection at every meal and amazing quality.  We considered paying extra for the sea front rooms, but having read reviews about them on here we didn't, and i'm so glad.  Those rooms look right onto the public beach and there is a hotel walk way running straight past them.  Our view was at the side, but we still had a view of the water.  The location was perfect.  I'd definitely advise saving your money on this one.  I would have paid more for the room we had, because of the privacy.  Now the biggest positive.  It was my birthday when we stayed, and my partner arranged a special meal for us. …",Date of stay: November 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

We reached the hotel at around 4:30 PM and we were allotted only two rooms by Pranay and was told that a room is still under cleaning. When we went to the room we were surprised to know that the two rooms allotted was double beds, i was surprised that how did they allot a double bad when we were couples and moreover with an infant. We informed Pranay and then he allotted us the two rooms immediately with single beds on the same floor. Now two things happened here: 1. Why were we kept waiting for the third room when there were already vacant room on the same floor and not far to the third room? 2. Why were we given double bed occupancy room when we were with infants and not king size bed?…",Date of stay: October 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Staff: 5/5 Special shout out to Delilah at Marriott for going the extra mile to ensure a beautiful vacation. She was constantly in touch even before the trip began, attending to every single detail. From the smooth check-in to the room upgrade to the early second check-in to the surprise honeymoon décor of the room, every aspect was a delight.

I am giving our stay a FIVE star due to  an overwhelmingly higher number of pros over cons. Like in any place, there are downsides, but it is how they are made up eventually.   Pros:  1. The travel desk is great; I had booked an airport pickup and there were folks promptly guiding all Marriott guests on our arrival.

To prove that Jr.Sous Chef Rajesh Gawade presented to us his signature preparation. It was lip smacking and convinced as that it was as good as the dish we had in a highly recommended restaurant.

They take feedback regularly and (to my surprise) worked on it in the very next meal. Only disappointment was to not see much seafood except a few fish dishes, didn't expect that for a goan star property.   The rooms were also very lean and comfortable.   What lacked was that it was a very small property to be called a resort, especially for the price.

I didn't feel the need to ever go to the beach/shacks to get the Goan experience as that can be had right from your balcony. The biggest plus point of this property is their staff who go above and beyond to make things happen for their guests. This attitude is uncommon even in some famous international hotels I have stayed in, and that made all the difference for me.

TV was not configured to India setting, and they came almost 24 hours after to fix. Delivery on food also is not great.  They do not offer cycles etc for a quick go around for guests.  Layout is quite complex, so to walk from one wing to other, it takes more than 20min. Gym, sauna etc was in the opposite wing, so half the time we ended up not going as it was too much of a walk in rains.  Food is average.

The Restaurant breakfast was managed so efficiently with Rajendra and team Delana, and chef Priya Ranjan and Data Guru And others were always on theirs toes to make sure every guest is fully satisfied.   The Chinese Wan Hao is a must visit and specially Chez Azmir Sheikh understands authentic Asian Cuisine and the green Thai curry was to die for, and the server Napoleon did a fantastic job and always on the run.   3 cheers to the entire team for a very homely feeling and impeccable stay.",Date of stay: August 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Must mention about the staff; 3 women were running the place: front desk i think her name was Dylena. There was 2 other ladies at the breakfast area and were very hospitable.

"My wife and I stayed here bang in the middle of the monsoon season in Aug 2019. While the rain did play spoilsport we still had a wonderful time at the resort. The hotel seems to be a magnet for wedding parties and celebrations. So keep that in mind while booking your stay.   The staff at the hotel is very well-trained, hospitable and pleasant. Every day, we had a surprise in the form of a towel-art waiting for us in the room (see attached pic). In fact, the resort had classes for towel-art which we unfortunately missed. :(.   The food at the hotel is quite good. The buffet is a nice spread of Indian and Continental. However, it does get a bit repetitive after a day or two. So, we switched to the a la carte menu after a while. The resort also has a wonderful bakery and cafe…",Date of stay: August 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Dining staff are most attentive if not a bit over zealous to make sure you are pleased. We were treated like royalty!  Very clean hotel with comfortable beds and lots of hot water. Very quiet and relaxing room. Beautiful grounds. The 30m pool is exceptional for morning laps and opens at 6:00 am. They offer day drivers for 1500INR and we found it good value.   Needs work. Check in was clunky at best. Stood in line at security behind two taxi drivers arguing with hotel staff for what seemed a very long time when finally someone asked why we were there.  Explained that we had a reservation, and we were informed that our room was unavailable…",Date of stay: August 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

"Overall this is not a 5 Star resort currently.  Best estimate is 3 star.   This is a Marriott hotel and should be better.  We were disappointed generally with our week long stay.  We booked a suite which was supposed to be refurbished but this was dull and lifeless despite the fact we did have space.  For example the patio doors had a gap of several cm around the edge and daylight was visible.  The furniture was stained and fusty, AC worked but not great. Beds were not as comfortable as you expect at a Marriott.  Although the towel art was beautiful each day.  This is India and things are different.

The staff are well trained and very obliging and courteous at all times. From our experience every member of staff we interacted with went the extra mile to meet our needs. After we were shown to our room we realised we were not too happy due to the room being on the ground floor and we requested to be moved and the house guest manager Dililah immediately came to our room and after listening to our concerns immediately moved us to a suitable room.

If it’s Goa and you need to stay near Panjim the Marriot is the only option you should consider.  Well maintained property with great view of mandavi River and Arabian Sea. Lush green area and clear swimming pool. Must spend sun set with your loved ones. Plan to take another road trip from “Bombay to Goa” and stay in Marriot.  It’s the perfect balance between Serenity of South Goa and crowded North Goa(calangute beach )   Only down side is food prices are exorbitant. But considering your staying near city center there are plenty of options outside.,Date of stay: March 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We stayed at the hotel for a family vacation with parents and children and it turned out to be a memorable vacation.  The sea facing rooms offered great views of the Arabian Sea with the sunsets being especially beautiful. The breakfast buffet spread had a wide variety and was delicious. The lounge, where we enjoyed the “Happy Hours” in the evening, laid out a buffet of snacks while offering interesting cocktails. However the highlight of the stay was the staff- with every person going out of his/ her  way to make us feel welcome.  Prerna and Arantxa at front desk, Mamta in F&B, Paramveer & Vinayak in the restaurant, Urmila in housekeeping  and the Azur lounge staff were just some of the people who made it a special holiday for us.

The beaches were an absolute disappointment. But the hotel and the spa were acceptable for a quiet weekend getaway.,Date of stay: February 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

As for us, I am fortunate to have met Mr Vinayak who is at the helm of the affairs at Waterfront where nothing can go wrong. He checks on each of his guests and sees tat they are comfortable and get wat they want. As I had my lil grandson of two and half years with us, Mr Vinayak asked him "" wat do you want for dinner?""

SUNBURN IN GOA. We were regular visitors to sunburn in Goa in the past years.  This year too we drove down to Goa but the fest was somewhat a disappointment what with a smaller crowd .  We therefore  took off to Panjim on the second day and stayd at Hotel Manvins -- a nice Hotel  bang in the middle of Panjim city. It has a very pretty view of the city and river Mandovi . The  view of the beautifully lit up and newly inaugurated Mandovi Bridge was magnificient.  There was music in the garden below the Hotel and it was quite enjoyable.   Before going to the show we took the boat cruise which In  fact is just across the road from this Hotel. The music and dancing made up a bit for what we lost at the Sunburns of the past. We will surely  recommend this city hotel  to our friends.…,Date of stay: March 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

One of the few good resort situated in capital Panaji is this hotel which has a amazing location(right across the beach) and amazing hospitality and clean rooms. probably the only down side was the food. i am not saying it was bad but with Marriott's class it could have been little better.

It's more like the backwaters which was a bit of a disappointment. The location of the hotel isn't the best either as it's based in and around the main city area.  However, a shout out to all of the lovely staff at the hotel. The service was exceptional. The hotel chef's were most helpful in whipping up different stuff for my 1 year old. The rooms were nice and the staff always courteous.

"I chose the Marriott Resort for a solo 2 day staycation in March 2019 after looking at its great reviews on Marriott’s website.  On the whole, the resort isn’t bad and most people will be satisfied mostly due to its grandeur and it’s plethora of facilities.  My gripes with this property were rather minor individually but they did add up.   Firstly, the beach - This flag end of Miramar beach is anything but private. The day tripping boats from Panjim harbour right in front of the resort for blaring music and it is endless! Other resorts in Goa so truly have a private beach. This was the biggest problem I had.   Secondly, the rooms - I was in a bay view room which offers great views however, there is a walkway right under the rooms and it’s easy to see through the untainted glass…",Date of stay: March 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The staff and the food helped to make our stay special and memorable, my thanks to Delana for your  perfect day out recommendations, and sous chef Dataguru for being so charming and Paramvir for your sense of humor.

Allthough we especially remember the above employees, in the end, everyone at the hotel was very professional and made our stay super special.   The hotel was very nice and our rooms (a bit dated) were very comfortable and clean. We saw the carpets along the halls being cleaned but unfortunately stains can’t be removed thus they look old and unkept.   The beach is not private and I am sorry to say was a sad site (no fault of the hotel, I assume).

"I was at the Goa Marriott for 6 days, and by the end of my stay, I was not willing to leave. The property is located right on the beach, so the swimming pool, lobby, and restaurants all have an unmatched view of Mandovi river and the Arabian Sea. There is a poolside bar, which makes the experience all the more luxurious. The breakfast buffet, which although I felt had a limited number of choices for a health-conscious eater like me, had wonderful servers who personalise your experience (look out for this guy called Paramvir, he's the best). Don't miss out on the jacuzzi and spa - it's one thing a lot of guests forget about but Marriott Goa has a great one! It has all the feels of a Turkish hammaam.

"Have been coming to goa Marriot now for many years, initially as a staying guest but in more recent years as a member if the gym and spar. I have to say that the level of service you receive from the spar and gym staff is second to none, from the manager Moncy to house keeping. Moncy always ensures that all your needs are met and staff work in a professional manner.  We always like to take a massage package which is always good value when purchased in this manner, my massage by Riaz is amazing, just the correct amount of pressure but enough to make it therapeutic, I always feel so refreshed.

Room view (bay) was marvellous, ambiance were superb, food was delicious, and the staff was very cooperative and kind, especially at the breakfast (lakhan, paramveer, and Miss Kiran) and recreation (Miss Valiny) who were taking care of us and giving us personal attention. Housekeeping was excellent. Check in and check out staff was very efficient.

Lost a few pounds, and toned up as well in a short time, got lots of great comments on my appearance.

The hotel management is awesome and you can expect nothing but a spectacular service throughout your stay; be it the restraunts, rooms, pool side. The hotel takes you into a different world the moment you step into the lobby. The lobby opens right on the beach and I can bet that you will be left spellbound! The hotel is located in Panjim and so it's a bit far from the tourist preferred location of Goa like Candolim but that's a choice which you have to make.

I was pretty upset with that, with being one of the most expensive hotel in goa you have expectation but I guess I bought basic room and that was the problem I guess.

We were treated royally right from the time of check-in till it was time to bid adieu to Goa.  The lavish breakfasts, the mind boggling dinner buffets and the very generous offerings of appetizers and cocktails at the lounge were truly delightful. There was something for everyone.

If you want great customer service and food and a lower bill go to The W resort(which we were also not staying at). It took 60 mins  at the Marriott to get one cocktail in the lobby and 3 people and 4 attempts to get the bill correct- we should have left then but we didn't.

We visited the hotel in November. Location of the hotel was center to the city so travelling to north and south Goa beaches was almost an hour away. The property was on the beach but lot of boats were coming to that spot to drop and pick people so it did not have a feeling of a private beach. Even though they had a security guard standing at the entrance still I did not find it safe. Swimming pool was small. Apart from this the food was excellent.

The Goa we anticipated and wanted was funkier, more chilled, with the ethnic vibe that Goa is famous for.  So, whilst The Goa Marriott is a good hotel, the location is very average.   Miramar beach has literally nothing on it and I mean nothing at all. It's not particularly attractive, although it is reasonably clean.  The immediate area surrounding the hotel is also not particularly interesting, being the suburbs of Panjim.  Panjim is ok, but it's a normal, small city.

If I had to give an award, it would go to the young guy at the poolside (I believe his name was Pavan), his smile was infectious as was his dedication to providing service to all those by the poolside. He worked at that pool as if it was his own & what a pleasure it was to come…",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We stayed in this hotel for three days in July 2018 when we took a short trip from Bangalore where we worked at that time.  I selected Goa Marriott hotel because it had good reviews on TripAdvisor and also because it was right on the beach. There are plenty of good hotels in Goa, but not all of them are on the beach and I really wanted to see Arabian see from the hotel window, so we decided on Marriott.  We enjoyed out stay a lot and I am happy to add my review to a pretty long list of favorable reviews of this place.  When we went to Goa, we knew it was off-season, so the goal of our trip was not to enjoy the ocean which is pretty impossible at this time of the year, but to experience the cultural heritage that Goa has to offer.

"A very old Marriott that needs some work and makes it overpriced for what you get. We actually changed to the Azaya where we got such a different experience. The best of the Marriott is the service and the bed experience, both signs of Marriott identity. Food was good in the restaurant, the gym was nice… however on the other side the hotel itself is quite old and you can notice it, as an example the pool does not invite to go in, it is green seeming to be dirty and the tails are falling. Some of the work is already in progress as all its restaurants (but one) are now closed.

But when we arrived at Marriott Resort & Spa at Panjim I felt like saying Dil mange more. We had a great welcome at the Marriott with a welcome drink, Goan songs ( Live band) and such a pleasant team of Marriott.  When we arrived there was a wedding happening and all the nicce rooms were booked by the wedding families. It's obvious not a big surprise. But when we got our room we felt we were tucked away in one corner. Initially we were not very happy but our request was taken very seriously and next day we were offered the best room.

I specifically reminded the hotel of the mix up and told them to ensure the man holding the name board got my name right.  Sure enough the following morning there was the hotel representative holding a name board with the wrong name. That was the first disappointment.

"Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location, even in the off season with it being monsoon.  However, we were badly let down by the only bar in the complex with tv being off limits to a private party. Offered the restaurant with no tv or the lobby lounge, also with no tv. As Scottish fans keen on the World Cup we were very disappointed.   Find it hard to believe even in off season that there are no bars showing sport in the hotel.  Somehow I can’t imagine this having happened with IPL being shown. Seems a bit off with the Club rooms being ‘sold off’ to private party. It’s my first time here at this hotel and have been disappointed with this.

Half the things on the menu were unavailable and what was available was well below average. You get better food dished out from a street food van. Samantha, the chef at the coffee shop Waterfront, used to dutifully make sure all her guests are well taken care of and would even go out of her way to cook up some off-the-menu, lip-smacking Goan fare.

While I was swimming I saw random people strolling and peeping into the pool.  Secondly, getting in touch with anyone at the property via phone/email is a hassle. I tried getting in touch numerous time before checking in. It was such a task.  The property is well maintained and beautiful. Especially the lobby.

I walked in as a person who hated Marriott and in ten hours stay, Vaman sold me club Marriot membership too. Such was power of Vaman, Delana, Mohit, Rajeev. Kudos  team!  Breakfast is sumptuous.

All restaurants were just amazing both in food  and services. 4. Located very ideally in midst of south and north Goa which makes you easily swing Between both.  Negatives 1. Snail pace internet connection. Worst I ever came across. Inspite of many complaints ....no respite. 2. We were accommodated in the floor, where we had lot of stag guests, which disturbed the silence of the vicinity.",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"If there was an award for the worst run Marriott hotel then this hotel will run the award hands down. I had a private function and the entire experience was horrible. The management who run this place should not be in the hospitality industry as they don’t have an ounce of concern for the paying customer. Even being a Platinum member of the Marriott program didn’t stop the folks who run the place to levels of service you will never expect in the hotel industry. After this experience I have stopped patronizing the Marriott hotel chain. There are better hotels in Goa who will offer far greater levels of service then the folk’s running this hotel can ever dream off. So one advice to the folks reading this review, find another place to take your business and you won’t regret it.",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"This 5 star resort is what one may call the perfect location for a perfect holiday. This beautiful hotel is located near the capital of Goa i.e. Panaji and is right along the shores of Miramar beach. The property is massive and maintained beautifully. Consisting of various category rooms with different views, a well equipped gym, spa, pool, lounge and much more; this hotel is a holiday on its own for its residents. The food is good, nothing extremely impressive (considering the pricing) and service is friendly. Once n a while they host festivals such as food festivals, pop up exhibitions and so on which can add a fun element to your stay. The pool is mesmerizing! its right next to the beach to while you swim you have view of the sea and an in pool bar!",Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Great resort with the best access to the beach which stretches for miles. The pool is excellent and the poolside restaurant is great especially in the evening. Good for snacks and the staff are very well trained and helpful. The rooms and all the common areas were very clean and could not fault the staff or the hotel.  Would recommend this highly to get away from the hustle and bustle.

"We come to Marriott regularly for lunch and dinners and often times opt for the buffet. I have multiple allergies and in our last few visits the staff & chef have been actively involved in suggested what from the buffet spread can be eaten. This time however, I was a little disappointed with the dessert counter as everything had something that I was allergic to- so it meant no desserts. I tried making do with some fruits but yet the experience felt incomplete. While discussing the matter with one of the staff Mr. Paramvir, he offered to go & see what could be done. In sometime, he was back with a sizzling brownie with chocolate sauce and ice-cream at the side. We really appreciated this gesture as I was eating out after a long time and was greatly happy that the dinner ended on…",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We had lunch here one day during a trip to Old Goa and Panjim from Arossim Beach.  Despite the inviting views from the lobby over the river, we were somewhat disappointed with the ambience of the hotel in general.  It felt more like a business hotel than a holiday destination, perhaps because it was in the middle of a city and not surrounded by verdant fields or on the beach.  But the staff, too, behaved more as if they catered to business clients than tourists.  The restaurant was very average. Compared to our own eating experiences at the Park Hyatt, we found the service appalling and food ordinary. Beware of buying drinks to accompany your meal.  They are exorbitant and have taxes and service charge added.

I stayed here two nights with my wife & 1 year old son to celebrate the laters 1st birthday at this property, of course the reviews from other experiences helped make that choice, which I thought would be a great decision considering the reputation the chain carries and my past experiences in their other properties around the globe.   My first order to room service on the day we checked in was made at 5.30pm and was eventually delivered after 3 hours at 8.45pm, with an explanation that the guy who took the order forgot to punch it in the system which led to this delay, the misery was such that eventually when the order got delivered…",Date of stay: February 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

We visited Goa with my senior parents and 2 young children (9 years old). The accommodations were very clean. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The staff is very very courteous. There is nothing they won’t do for you.  You just need to ask. I did find that they were more concerned with making sure you dined with them rather than going off the resort.  The restaurants were expensive in terms of what we were paying in different parts of India but I think that’s relative to the Marriott name. They were able to provide us with a shuttle to and from the airport for a fee.  Our rooms were cleaned daily and interesting towels animals were made which was fun.

After a month long trip around India this was 5 days of pure luxury. The attention to detail and customer service of this hotel will blow your mind. And as a Platinum SPG/Marriott member you shouldn’t look at anywhere else in Goa. The pool was almost always empty over looking a quiet beach. The gym is better than the one I pay for on a monthly basis back in Australia. And the Exec lounge has enough food and drink to keep you struggling to fit in dinner with their pre-dinner snacks and cocktails. Special thanks to Santosh (club lounge) and Ashwin (sous chef) who helped direct me when it came to sampling the food and the numerous cocktails!!!! Can not recommend highly enough.

Two coffees (very small) from their bar/cafe were 600 rupees PLUS everything comes with 22% tax and sometimes other taxes too. This  meant to small coffees were £8 or $11.50. That's crazy.  Two double G&Ts turned out to be £34 or around $49!  Biggest mistake we made was booking the ""all inclusive"" option on Expedia.  What this meant was meals included AND ONLY at the buffet restaurant (they have 2 other a la carte restaurants).

First and foremost, the staff is wonderful, especially Sanket at the front desk, who seemed to take it as his personal mission to make sure we had the best time imaginable, and who, like a genie, seemed to appear anytime we needed anything, or if there was an opportunity to enhance our experience.  Not to minimize how great ALL the staff were - always working to accommodate anything we wanted.

She arranged a cake for my daughter during my last visit to the same property  and this time, again she arranged the cake even though her birthday falls next month.

Miss Delilah and her team were on their toes throughout our stay to give us a great experience. Knowing that it was our daughter's first birthday, we were also given a complimentary cake!

To name a few, I will mention the pros of the property It is lavish to an extent that it may spoil its guests From the top level to the bottom most, the entire staff is ready to serve their guests like no others. I was given the best suite of the property and it was huge, spotlessly clean, with breathtaking sea view from the balcony, very interestingly decorated and an elephantine washroom. The suite even had an extra small washroom to ensure privacy if there are more guests.  All the toiletries served and refilled time to time, the minibar was ensured to have been left saturated.  The towels and bathrobes were clean and smelled nice.  Excellent sleep quality. Room service is top notch and the…",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Goa Marriott has probably the best and cleanest beach in Goa. Its a property located closest to the waters and where the waves are mild and great for a family.  Hotel has the best of housekeeping service; we had a ground floor garden facing room   and we thoroughly used the patio during our stay; they offer a very tasty breakfast spread; every day a chef asked for our preferences and took care to serve the best. You can get cycles to ride on the beach on the days when sand is not so wet and you can ride for a long stretch. . Another huge advantage with this hotel is its location. . .its walkable distance from Panji and the walk is on a nice mostly tree lined pavement. Casinos as well as Kala academy are walkable distance, although Marriott itself has a decent sized casino. Taxis…",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Of the myriad options available in five stars in Goa, I took the best decision when I chose Marriott. Their exuberance and warmth started the moment we stepped in, right from the reception till the time we bid adieu. Chef Ashwin, Delana Pai to name a few took such detailed care, that I don't think I would have managed my week long journey with my 3 year old without their help.  I would unabashedly recomend this beautiful property to everyone visiting Goa with their little devils.  Thanks Marriott for your love !!!",Date of stay: July 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
We had the most amazing 5* example of what customer service should be like from Delilah. Delilah went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed and more. Nothing was too much of a trouble.   However my first impression was not so good as it took nearly an hour to complete the entire check in process. There were other people just barging in and staff had no control what so ever. The check in clerk was probably under trained. The Duty Manager was very rude and unprofessional. He did not have any customer service etiquettes. We were not served welcome drinks. I was a bit upset the way they both spoke to me.  Delilah came from no where and within seconds everything was sorted. She is a life saver and an assest to the hotel. She dealt very professionally and apologetic.…,Date of stay: October 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

I was bowled over by the hospitality of the staff. we had some trouble with the cab arrangements on arrival and i was worried how the trip would turn out. Delilah the guest relationship manager went out of the way to ensure we had a fantastic trip. The hotel is great, spotlessly clean and in a beautiful location at the confluence of the river with the sea. But what made this one of our best trips was the hospitality of the staff.

"Staying in Panjim at the moment with my husband’s parents so we are doing the rounds of the international hotels for use of pool, bar and lunch facilities during the day. Spending today at the Marriott and this is by far the worst (and unfortunately most expensive) experience we have had. The pool clearly has not been tiled for many years so it looks dated and grubby. The pool area is not kept clean (there were two used plasters on the poolside as I was getting in this morning, ants and bird poo all over the tiled area surrounding the pool).

A big thumbs up to them for this 👍👍.   The property albeit smaller in size as compared to other five star properties in South Goa, offers all the comforts one can ask for.  The only issue we had was with their travel desk for local transport. Though they do offer standard  packages, the same is not well communicated to the patrons.

The towel art from Priyanka made us smile every day. The resort has a fantastic pool and it's own very clean beach. The food at the resort is 5 star. There are many options. We bought the food included package with our room. We found ourselves making sure to get back to the hotel for each of our meals because it had such a variety and was so fresh.

We the hotel picked us up from the airport, it’s about a 45min drive from the airport.  The lobby is breathtaking. We were greeted by name with welcome drinks and  seashell necklaces. Check in was easy and very accommodating.   Our room is stunning and it’s only a standard. The gym was huge and one of the best gyms I’ve visited. They even had a children’s club across from the gym.   The food overall is fantastic. We ate everyday at the waterfront restaurant and I think that was the highlight.

The checkin step is where the pampering starts, we’re warmly welcomed by seashell necklaces and refreshing drinks. I’m a gold elite member but really didn’t expect such a special treatment by this Marriott staff. Our room was well decorated with flowers and towel crafts. The handwritten welcome note and goodies in the room were a perfect gesture of loyalty appreciation. We thoroughly enjoyed the lounge, pool and the beach, kids had a blast.

Breakfast spread at the restaurant is lavish and includes all you can think of. We travelled with a sick toddler and the staff went out of the way to make him feel better, preparing and packing all of his favorites for our day trips. Delana Pai and all the chefs at the restaurant deserve an applause for this. They have a beautiful spa which one should definitely not miss. The pool though is a bit small and the beach in front of hotel not that happening.

The bay view rooms were perfect with the view of Miramar beach, which is a perfect place for a quiet morning/evening stroll as this beach has no commercial activity as such.   Then we ran into Mr. Sanket Athavale at the reception and we're glad we did. He was a wonderful host and his recommendations of stuff to do and places to eat in Goa were spot-on!

The Marriot Hotel in Panjim Goa is in my opinion a first class experience from the minute you walk through the doors.

It was spacious , had a stunning view of the Mandovi river with almost everything we wanted for a truly memorable vacation . We ate at the Coffee shop as well as the Chinese Speciality restaurant and both the meals were fantastic. They also have a open air restaurant next to the poolside but it was closed due to monsoons at that time. I would recommend this property to everyone . it is located very close to panjim city but when you are at the resort, it seems totally scheduled and private .

I had requested for a beach view room which was happily given provided the rush due to the holiday season. Their breakfast buffet is comprehensive and the variety is appreciable. Room space is at par with the competition but the attention to detail in the interiors is something that mesmerizes the senses. All in all an excellent experience at the property.

"The Goa Marriott Resort & Spa is no doubt a fine hotel.  The local is spectacular, right on the Miramar Beach.  The pool is fine, not deep and not a lap pool, but a good spot to relax with the view of the bay and hills.  The rooms are excellent as expected.  The service is lovely.  And the breakfast buffet is really top-notch.  Access to the sights of Goa is also easy.  There is one big problem, however: the pricing is way out of whack with the overall experience.  I travel a huge amount in India, and can tell you first-hand that the Rs.22,000 a night we were charged is almost twice what we should have paid.

Their service was outstanding, it is not exxagerated to say that the staff accomodated us in every extent, even with a late check out. Breakfast was very good, with a wide selection of food, international and indian.  The only negative thing we noted is that the food and beverage prices are a bit high. So we mostly eat outside.

The hotel is not very large, but it's located on the banks of the river with stunning views from the front of the hotel. I prefer this actually, as almost all the larger hotels are some way away from the beach and therefore offer more distant views of the waterfront. At the Marriott, you feel like you're in the water, the grounds are that close. The pool is wonderful if a little small. The Qian spa is excellent as well.

The hotel has a spa with a jacuzzi and steam room, which we used. We also booked in for massages, which were very relaxing.

"We stayed at Marriott Goa for a short one-night stay but had a good time. Nice property, facing the Miramar beach and Mandovi river convergence. Though the beach is not as clean as many other beaches in goa. There is a direct access to the beach from the hotel itself.   Staff was very courteous and helpful. Check-in and check-out was very smooth. We got an upgrade to a bay view room which was spacious and had a nice view of the sea from the window.  We really loved spending our time in and around the pool. Nice seat out area with lot of open space, beautiful landscaping, and comfortable chairs around the pool facing the river.

There are many options in Goa and I thought that Marriot should be obvious choice as I have ever stayed in Marriot in London(Manchester, Birmingham,London), Paris, Barcelona and I am aware of the quality so why take chances though I was suggested other names as well. I did all bookings and hoped all would go well.  We reached the Hotel and the whole family was so impressed as it was a surprise. First impressions are excellent as soon as you arrive.

The restaurant placed near the city with a view that is too good living up to the standards of the brand Marriott's at Miramar Panjim situated near the Miramar beach but the access road to that place is on the interior. With a slightly congested parking place they provide vallet thou the reception area itself is nice with a view the pool and the food is good but the way getting to your room is like getting through a haunted corridor well once u reach the room it's a nice cozy wonderful room a bit congested but that will do as most of them provide rooms with views so it was loving experience.,Date of stay: September 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"We were the 3rd in 4 back-to-back weddings taking place, thus explaining why the place was in shambles. Rooms were allotted at 5 pm, with functions starting at 7 pm. The layout needed GPS-enabling because it was really confusing getting to the rooms and everywhere else. The rooms were pretty decently sized but felt small with little walk-around space, worse with the wedding luggage and the desperately needed pedestal fans. The bathrooms were big but the doors needed fiddling to shut properly. The maintenance was a joke because ACs did not cool, telephones didn't call and tables wobbled badly enough to displace everything on them.

After staying in a hospital to take care of my mom for 3 continuous weeks, I badly needed a break. I randomly chose to come to Goa to rejuvenate myself, and specifically chose the Goa Marriott because of the Marriott Gold Elite benefits.

"well this time we stayed here in the end of May 2017, I mus admit that this was an equally refreshing experience experience as the last one. This time we were at the ground floor room & felt as good as being in the Arabian sea. The view from the room was as good as it can be.Also we were lucky enough to witness a day full of heavy showers which made it even a more memorable visit for us. I must admit that the quality of breakfast has improved so much since the last time we were there.  Simply grill as always lives upto the expectation.The cocktails they serve is truly amazing. As usual a very warm & friendly staff.

"This was my 12th or 13th trip to Goa, and having visited a lot of properties here. I can say this is one of the best in the city.   Located in the North, which is the most happening area in Goa gives it a plus plus. I had a Patio Bayview room which had amazing sea and pool view and had a very convenient access to the swimming pool, which was really helpful as I was accompanied be an elderly person. The room was spacious and had everything you might need in a room when you're on a holiday.  The Miramar beach is just 6-7 minutes walking and accessible from the hotel.

"Delayed review, but nevertheless, here goes - I had heard that it was difficult to get a reservation over a long weekend, and now I know why. Breathtaking views of the Mandovi meeting the sea (especially during the sunset) coupled with world class Marriott hospitality and amenities that fulfil the needs of the business traveler or a leisurely family vacation. Tip- take the breakfast package and you will not regret it. Sip a kokum infused martini IN the poolside bar, sip on wine in the lounge, or just have a romantic bbq dinner with the south d of the waves in the background... It's an experience that will make you stay an extra night/day and makes you want to visit again.",Date of stay: May 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Not sure why I never stayed here before! Everything about this resort is ideal! The location is ideal if you want to be in Panjim (a good walk from downtown Panjim and yet, by the water/beach, etc). The food at this property is very good (the spread offered at breakfast is impressive). Finally, I would give a five star rating for the service offered by the staff here!   The property sprawls along the bay and so, depending on where you are, it may take for ever to get to your room but once you get to your room, you will find that the nicely done and with the right balance of comfort and design.

This beach is not very crowded and is pretty good for morning walks. The poolside view of this resort is spectacular considering you can spend time in the pool adjacent to the sea.  Our stay was made comfortable right from the beginning. Lucky for us, few rooms were available and Mr. Sankat who looks after guest relations was kind enough to upgrade our rooms from Garden view to Bay view. The room view was breath taking.

My wife and I spent two nights in Goa Marriott Resort and Spa recently. We booked a room with a bay view and a patio. Our package included free airport pick up and drop and breakfast which was good. The room was spacious and had a great view of Miramar Bay. The patio was nice but needs to have an awning else its use is limited in the rain and hot sun. The hotel has a spa and an infinity pool which are good although I do wish they would not play loud music at the pool side. The hotel is on Miramar beach which is Ok but not one of the really good ones in Goa. The hotel is 3 to 4 km from the city centre which an be easily accessed by bus auto or cab.

Every single team member we came across was seen giving out their 100%. They were all out ensuring that we were enjoying ourselves. The chefs were seen interacting with almost every guest in the restaurant checking on satisfaction. The front office team guided us very well on the places we should visit. The kids room is well equipped our children enjoyed playing there. There were various activities to keep the kids occupied, few my daughter tried were nail art, glass and pot painting.

"We travelled during mid May as a family of four including our twin 3 year old boys. Our package included round airport transfer and breakfast at the Waterfront restaurant. I am also a Marriott Gold. A week before the arrival, I got an email from the Guest Relations Manager to fill up a preferences form. Although most of it was already keyed in while making the reservation online at Marriott.com, this was a nice touch. The pickup was done in a Toyota Innova without any hassle. We had originally booked a standard bay view room. We were eventually upgraded to a bay view suite which was a splendid gesture. Although, I must say here that initially we had to ask more than once at the reception for this upgrade.

"I would rate this property 5 on 5! I travelled to Goa lately and had to shift my hotel due to extended stay and this property was the nearest to my work site. I was completely overwhelmed by the view this property offers. My after work evenings were just splendid - at the spectacular waterfront sea facing pool and bar. This property is a juxtapose of beach, pool, bar and scrumptious food - all that one needs in Goa. The staff was very polite and prompt. My overall stay for two days was just too incredible. This property has been existing for a long while now, but the timely refurbishment that it does, keeps the overall design and ambience too fresh and new! I appreciate it from a designer's viewpoint.

Special mentions go to Murugesh, Ashwin, Ganesh, Delana (I hope I spelled her name right) and many more who were of help when we dined around a dozen times at the Waterfront Terrace and Bar. Shivani at the front desk was really helpful too, for she catered to us by suggesting good restaurants nearby and local sightseeing. The staff showed great amounts of kindness and it made me feel very content. The only thing I regret about my stay is that I lost count of the countless number of people who deserve special mentions and therefore couldn't mention them all. Will definitely come back for future stays.",Date of stay: May 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

You may think this is how it should be ...but this marriott takes it to another level.  They are constantly seeking feedback and they act on it almost instantly.

"We spent a couple of nights at JW Marriott. I was amazed with everything which Marriott staff did to make our stay pleasurable. I was to arrive by Goa Express from Pune to Goa, but had made the mistake of reserving my train journey only till Madgaon. But Marriott, did not disappoint, they sent the complimentary car pickup right upto Madgaon, a good 45 minutes away.   The kids hit off with the front desk staff early enough and were pampered during their entire stay. At the restaurant,  I was missing some of my typical vegetarian dishes, and while I was nursing these thoughts, the Chef Dattaguru walked up right upto me and asked how could he help.  I was frank enough to explain that I was missing some of my staple dishes for the lunch buffet.

A trainee Tamal and staff member Delina also made the experience great with the support and customer oriented qualities that hospitability industry thrives on.

The hotel is next to the city at the mouth of the river.  If you are looking for a beach holiday then I would head either north or south (with the best beaches about an hour south of town).

It is a loverly designed hotel with an open reception area allowing the sea breeze to blow into the open area. I think for people that are there to relax and enjoy Goa it is very good to cater for o their needs. My experience was not a good one as some of my colleagues as well. The room service menu states 45 min waiting. I guess for holidaying this is fine- but business guests come back late from work and need a quicker response.

The hotel overall is very well maintained, rooms are expertly cleaned and maintained, and is at a location that allows for moving around the city pretty simple.  The housekeeping staff were excellent, with towels made up of different animals every day when they cleaned the room. The check-in and check-out processes were well managed and quick.  The hotel can arrange an airport pickup for an additional cost, however, you'd be better off getting a pre-paid taxi from the airport, which comes out cheaper.

"I am writing this review for my mother who has no internet facility. This is my third stay at this sumptuous hotel, it truly deserves it's 5* rating. Everything about this hotel is wonderful, my only slight complaint ( which is not the hotels fault at all) is people flicking their cigarette ash and ends over their balconies as I again had to contend with their ash and cigarette ends on my balcony. The restaurant is amazing, the pool is lovely, the rooms are wonderful and I will definitely be staying here again in the future.

Went to marriot with my family and had a lovely tym.Goa has always been such a relaxing change from our hectic life and what makes it even better is dining at the Marriott with it beautiful breezy lobby. There were loads of option to dine in and   it was difficult choosing which one but finally we were able to make up our mind thanks to chef Samantha who was the most beautiful host and helped us with a small little trip around the lush green property. The food was amazing and what made it even better was chef Samantha's perfect hospitality and amazing desserts.

Although we were quite spoiled during our tour, staying  in the very best hotels, the Marriott was again a wonderful experience.  We had the bay view patio room which is just fabulous, with private  lounge chairs only meters from the sea.  Restaurant is also excellent with very very friendly staff, with in- and outdoor seating, with sea view and with the most wonderful spread of multi cuisine dishes and live cooking stations and sometimes live music for both breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Infinity pool at the sea side with the most beautiful sunsets.

"I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Goa Marriott Resort and Spa for three days at the start of a 2-week trip around India.  In that brief amount of time, I felt more welcomed and more catered to than I have ever felt at any property around the globe.  There was a real desire by the staff to find out your plans and needs and suggest ways to make your itinerary perfect.  The food on property was almost as amazing as the service.  Chefs on site at the buffet explaining local dishes, insisting that they make something fresh for you and bring it to your table even though it's a self-serve buffet.  Dishes changing day to day.  Great happy hour at Azur with its own appetizer buffet that can serve easily as dinner.  Well made cocktails and cold beers are served at the pool.  …",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The setting of the hotel itself is beautiful but I would have perhaps expected another swimming pool or greater grounds. That being said, we thoroughly enjoyed the facilities.

The Buffett restaurant offers a fantastic selection of high quality Indian and European meals which are simply delicious.

The word ""resort"" is also slightly misleading as the property is quite small with what can only be described as a decent size childrens pool.  So the positives, airport transfers were on time and communications were good prior to booking. The check in was smooth too and the cleaners do a good job on a daily basis. The gym was pretty good too.  The negatives:  Breakfast and dinner - we booked half board (which I wouldn't recommend). Breakfast was ok but the food for dinner was very poor.

The welcome at the hotel was fantastic - fresh juice and a complimentary upgrade to a sea view room. We decided to pay 2000 rupees per day to have access to the exec lounge (free soft drinks all day, 5-7pm free alcoholic drinks and buffet and breakfast) which was well worth it. The pool area is nice, the hotel in good condition and staff fantastic. We tended to walk into the main town and went out to a few fun karaoke bars on Thurs night.

I believe this is the best place to stay in Goa as it is in Panjim where you will not find a lot of Tourists which makes this place clam and peacefull.

The amenities and Service is impressive. I was delighted with the breakfast... a lot of good options to chose from.

It was a 1 day 1 night stay with husband. The property is beautiful and spent some relaxing time.

Nice spread with a wide variety of food which catered to most of my requirements. 3. Hotel location and access to beach is good. 4. I had requested for a VGA cable to project video from my laptop to the TV and the staff was very helpful and procured one for usage.

"Recently I visited Marriott to check rooms for my international guests. As i asked the staff to show me certain rooms I was shocked to see staff mopping the floor on their knees. This is never in my wildest dream i expected to see at a hotel chain like Marriott. On inquiry i was told that there are no moppers or mops in the hotel. Does the management know this scandolous situation? Or do they pretend not to know and waited till some guests exposed this. Firstly, this is inhumanitarian, secondly even the cheapest road side guest houses have mops for their housekeeping staff, so for a price charged I am sure Marriott Goa can provide mops to its staff.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

Nice hotel and pool. Rooms are good size and well equipped and reception area is impressive.   Service is generally very good albeit a little slow.   The location is ok but it's a bit away from the tourist areas which I guess is fine if you are looking to stay away from the hustle and bustle but a little annoying if your looking to explore what brings people to visit Goa.   We only stayed 2 nights and during that time there was a local wedding which very very colourful and noisy. However the noise generally stopped at 11.30pm so was fine for adults although I can imagine anyone travelling with children might have had some issues with this!

The next morning when staff asked how we were enjoying our stay we happened to politley mention this. We were advised there was a wedding and these things happen.

Not only because of my experience, but because of how I was treated by this hotel and the Marriott brand.  On the 20th, I was approached by an elderly gentleman in the lobby of the Marriott hotel (UK nationality) stating that he had been mugged the night prior, was beaten, and that his passport, wallet, and telephone were all stolen.  I immediately let my guard down since I was in the confines of the hotel – what is supposed to be a safe place.  The man was well educated, elderly, agitated and seemed to be in very rough shape.

Our new room, a 1brdm suite overlooking the Mandovi River, was pretty nice but a tad outdated. Also, the room (rm. 384) had an odor which most likely originated from the drainage in the bathroom.

I phoned Marriott and they told it was to late (within 7 days of arriving).  The morning before I arrived the web site still showed a suite available for the entire stay cheaper than reservation. When I arrived the hotel told me all suites are sold out.  This scares me with the merger.   Starwood would always match the hotel rates no matter what the situation.

"Just got back to UK and as promised i am writing this review. The hotel was FAB. The location was quiet, but the town was easily accessed either by cab, tuck tuck or bus. Having never been to india before we were excited to experience the culture and people, we were not disappointed. The hotel itself was beautiful the staff kept it soo clean and welcoming. As a precaution we opted for the breakfast , unlimited soft drinks throughout the day and unlimited alcoholic drinks between 17:00 till 19:00 with a buffet served in the bar during the evening between the times stated. I would personally do this again, leaving you to experience the delights of Panjim later in the evening, unless you want to fill up on the buffet, easily done!

"We checked in Early on a Monday morning and had booked two Bay facing rooms. After an initial hiccups we got two rooms with a great view.  The Highlight of the resort is the Service. Everyone from the  Front desk, Restaurants and pool were eager to help. The service at the coffee shop was excellent and offered  a wide variety of food to satisfy every palate. We were on Full board package and enjoyed every meal.  The rooms look a bit old and the upholstery and bathroom fittings needs immediate attention  However the prompt service and the pleasant staff makes up for it.  The beach is relatively better than some of the other beaches in Goa. The beach may get a bit noisy between 10:00 am to 5:30 pm as private boat operators play loud music.   Overall a great vacation.

"After much of googling , chose Goa Marriot for our 3 day family trip to Goa. Yes, it was an absolutely right choice. One can see the hospitality to the core here right from your reception till check out, be at the beach or at the restaurant or anywhere in the hotel for that matter. All the staff are too good and polite.   We being vegetarians had no issues in comforting our taste buds. The water front 24 hour coffee shop was too good to resist from visiting. The buffet breakfast had a good spread.  We stayed in a bay view room and it was a feast for ones eye watching thro the bay and cruises from the room. Beach is just adjacent to the hotel , just a stones throw away. Too good and very private for evening walk and photo shoots.  Bottom line, Goa Marriott should be one's first…",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The first step to marriot let us felt like we entered our vary own palace, and belive me we were there for 5 days, but we had not visited every corner of the palace, so this is may became our reason to reach there again.

Invited to Indian Wedding as a couple along with plenty of other guests.  Hotel generally very nice although atmosphere unusual for a Marriott.

"Miramar, the beach near the Marriot Goa is smaller than many of the south Goa beaches abut the hotel makes up by its location in the heart of Panaji, the capital of Goa. So if want to do other things than   swim/sunbathe, this is a much better choice.   Convenient for shopping The main street for shopping  -- 18th June Road -- is nearby   and doing a day trip to Old Goa is also convenient  -- whatever mode of transport you chose.   In my experience none of these things are possible if you are stuck in a south Goa beach resort that is 2 hours motoring away from Panaji.

My husband and I stayed in one of the Bay Patio Rooms for 3 days in October.  I had already emailed the hotel prior to arriving to inform them that we would be celebrating my husband's 40th birthday and our wedding anniversary.  We received  a cake on arrival for his birthday and another one for our anniversary with complementary wine.   The Bay Patio Rooms are beautiful with amazing views of the river and beach.  We paid for full board in the waterfront restaurant. The service by all staff is worthy of 5 stars however one of the restaurant managers Saranash was exceptional. He went over and beyond everyday. The gym is well equipped and is 24 hours which is pretty handy.  The only downside for me is that the steam room in the spa had no steam as the door wouldn't close properly.…,Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Visited this property last month and stayed at one of the garden facing rooms. We are a family of three and had requested for two queen beds. Upon getting there we were told that we will have to pay an additional charge for the 'third' guest per night. I told the guys at reservation that I had mentioned that we are 3 guests when I was making the booking and had got a confirmation email stating '3 guests' and the final tariff. So why should an additional charge be incurred? He didn't have an answer and got me to forward my confirmation email to the admin. On the day of our checkout, he wasn't around and the one handling the checkout refused to help and got us to pay the extra.

However the hotel looks a bit run down, the furniture are not so new anymore, the humidity leaves its traces etc. Due to the layout you need to walk long distances to meeting rooms, bar, restaurant - and this up and down.

I live in India I don't get a lot of breaks or vacations. So when I do I want a good experience. We this was not a good one. We picked Marriott because I am a member and I always love them. When we arrived the hotel was old and they said it was 17 years old in fact. I still thought ok well it's a Marriott so they will make it better. But I was very very wrong. Yes it was raining and that it didn't help. Because we had to stay inside the hotel most of the time.   1. The food was just ok nothing like other Marriotts and it was really over priced.  2. We asked for a room with a balcony so we could at least sit outside. I said cost was no problem. They said next day we could move to a better room.

"I was in Goa for a three-day official visit and stayed in Goa Marriot resort. The place is 45 minutes drive from the Airport in the city of Panjim. The property itself is huge and well maintained. The rooms are spacious and clean and have good facilities on offer.  But there are few disappointments as well, the beach in the front of the resort is not good for enjoying. There is no complimentary Wi-Fi access, would be needed when you are on a business visit. The food was just ok.

"As expected and typical of Marriott hospitality, this place is amazing. Even though its in Panjim and people don't get as much attracted to Panjim as they do towards North ot South Goa, please do not miss a chance and stay here if you can.   Its located at Miramar beach and offers a fantastic view of the Bay area where the Mandovi river meets the Arabian sea. Try and go for the Bay view rooms which offer a sea facing view. You can take a nice long walk on the beach area right in front of the resort and it has a great pool side view.  Rest of the things are taken granted for.

"Had a feeling am going to the best Resort in Goa as I visited Marriott for the first time in 2014. But over the last 2 years, feel the customer service, especially at the front desk has really come down. Two instances which would make it clear. Being a member of their dining program, I went in an off-season to avail my free night. But much to my dismay, the room i was given was the corner mnost dingiest room anyone could get. And indeed miles away from the main restaurant with absolutely zero-views!! Secondly, next day when I seriously thought of staying till around 3 PM as my flight from the airport was at 6PM, they turned down my request stating that at best i can stay till 1PM.

Nice resort but their service needs to be upgraded. Stayed 2 days. On bother days I heard children and adults walking and yelling in hallways where rooms are located late at night - probably people coming back from bars / restaurants late night after a drink and no one from security to calm them down. So don't go if you want peace and quiet.   Overall the resort was decent. On the beach. Decent pool. And quite centrally placed.,Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"We stayed for 3 nights with two of our children aged 1 and 6, at Marriot. While it was a mixed feeling of our overall experience, what i would like to bring to Marriot and customers notice, is couple of instances at the hotel, which is not what i expected from a star hotel.  1. Check in at Marriot is at 4 p.m. and check out is at 12 noon. So based on that you will need to make your flight/travel arrangements. Their lunch timings is 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m., so if you are making a full board booking (including all meals), be assured to miss the lunch 2. On our first day, we went to the beach and were surprised that it was not kept clean.

The view is very good and frankly, no cause for complains.  The lobby has this lovely view and breeze of the bay coming in, which is a great thing. The restaurant called waterfront (i think), which serves the buffets, has a very tacky interior, but good size and great service.   The staff is exceptional, really..

The hotel is tucked away in the hustle of Panjim, the city however, not overly crowded when we were there.

Lovely spacious rooms, good dining options & relaxing spa add to making a good stay; the most outstanding aspect however, has to be the excellent staff that is extremely focused on guest satisfaction & live up to Marriott’s motto of putting people first & pursuing excellence.

"Stayed for couple nights. They have their best people to receive guests at the reception.  I was feeling a bit under the weather when I checked in and they offered an excellent masala chai which was such a relief.   The view from the lobby is something you cannot afford to miss, opens up to the sea and brilliant sea breeze is so comforting.  The rooms are spacious meets all your needs. Although I was disappointed with a garden facing one. Bet you cannot stay inside for a long time.  The restaurants offered good food but less variety for the dinner. I did enjoy the food at the chinese restaurant though it tasted more Indian with spice mixes.  Overall an enjoyable stay and would definitely revisit this place.",Date of stay: August 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Since we had never stayed at a Marriot property before this, we were not really sure what to expect. But from the word go, the staff made us feel comfortable. From an easy breezy early check in to the food, to the hospitality, this hotel has much to offer. The location of the hotel is a beauty!!!  We were, in particular, impressed by the staff of the hotel. I would like to, especially, compliment Vinod, Lorraine, Fauzan, Janaiah and Delilah (for directing us to the perfect souvenir shop in Panjim).  Oh and Priyanka for the beautiful towel Ganesha!! Thank you very much for making it a memorable holiday for us. I look forward to being at the Marriot Goa again, soon.",Date of stay: August 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We planned a family trip to celebrate my Brother In Law's 50th birthday and the staff at the Marriott were a big part of making the entire trip special.  On arrival, my Brother In Law's room was decorated with Balloons and Happy Birthday signs and the next day, the staff sent a cake for all of us to enjoy.  Our family was upgraded to a suite which was extremely comfortable and a good meeting place for the family.  So many great things about this hotel: - Beautiful Infinity pool - day and night with a swim up bar and dinner served pool side - Easy walk out to the beach - just a short walk to the swimming area - Best breakfast buffet - options galore (made to order dosa, puri, omelette, pancakes, parathas, capuccino) +…",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"The Marriott Goa is located in the city and is a stone's throw from Miramar beach. Sadly it does not have a private beach and the only access to the beach is dirty and not maintained by the hotel or civic department. The hotel itself is clean and the restaurant is marvelous. The restaurant is beautifully done up, the various counters, the bar, the outside seating area, all of them compliment each other and work nicely, so that you can have a meal and still have a good view of the restaurant. Staff is very helpful and attentive and no cause for complaints.

Food is ok. The ambience at reception needs slight improvement. There should be no hard and fast rule of wearing swimming constumes that does not cover the whole body, the sentiments of the people should be respected, although the pool manager knows the rights of the people but the duty boy should be also taught, it was quite embarrassing for me when he stopped me from going to pool for wearing full dress and not having Lycra material to which I am allergic, later solved by other manager but it did spoil my mood.

"Our stay at the Marriott was as usual fabulous. Definitely good value for money. The ambience is rich and when you look at the decor, the word opulence comes to your mind. Welcome drink is offered as and when you wish. The lobby is cozy and has a view of the beautiful pool and the sea. Since we stayed for four nights, we were offered free drinks at the bar every evening. The breakfast buffet is a combination of continental and Indian dishes which is so sumptuous that it could keep you going the whole day and the hotel has many restaurants if one wishes to order food.",Date of stay: August 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Goa round the year has its charm. During monsoons, far away locations with great beaches becomes less appealing as rain plays spoil sport. Also the well known shacks in its vicinity shut making food lovers travel distances to eat good food.   So travelling as a family with young children, we decided to stay in a central place, with good access to a beach and amply supply of entertainment nearby. What better place to stay than Marriott Resorts and Spa, Panjim as it overlooks the beach, has ample activity for everyone including a casino, kids center, three restaurants, live performances etc. you name it.

"This was the worst experience of mine with Goa Marriott.  Torn table mats laid for guests, bisleri cartoons scattered all over the  coffeeshop, my jeans which went for dry cleaning on my check in came damaged and accepted by the management, elevators from the lobby to the coffeeshop not functional for past 20 days and Hindus please be carefully as they tag their buffet wrong most often and that happened to me again this visit. They tagged pork sausages as chicken sausages. I as a HINDU BRAHMIN am  not allowed or ever touched pork n beef in the past 40 years. Pl make sure what you are eating.

A special mention to chef Gopi for taking into account the kids needs. Yes there were a few hiccups but nothing that couldn't be sorted! The room sizes are not too big.. In fact we weren't in the base category and i still found the rooms to be a little small. The beach sure needs to be cleaned up more often and a few beach chairs wouldn't hurt either!

I have reviewed this hotel earlier also but this time it is more like expressing my gratitude. I was here with my family for eight days . It really became home and I can't but not thank the following people without whom the stay would not have been half as much fun. *Sanket for making everything so easy and helping out at every stage. Thanks for the babinca. *Sukhdev for keeping the room so clean and also for the swans and butterflies. *Manuj for those long chats during breakfast and the chocolate cake and tea bags. *Leroy for his ever smiling presence and those 'to die for' cakes just out of the oven. *And last but not the least all the boys and girls at the waterfront who made our breakfast so enjoyable and memorable. Hope to be back soon.,Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"We were in Goa for the weekend and decided to have lunch at the Marriott. After travelling all the way from North Goa where we were staying, we arrived at the restaurant which was a mess (not even half full). Nobody to acknowledge or assist, we walked around looking for a table. We had to literally attract the attention of colleagues to confirm whether we could sit in a particular section. When we requested for the A la carte menu, as we had a late breakfast, we were told that we have to go for the Brunch only and a la carte won't be served. It was a rude shock as not everyone would like the Brunch spread or have the appetite to eat that much. The response was mechanical, the staff looked confused and in rush. A simple apology with a smile would have been sufficient.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

"My experience from the moment I arrived and was greeted to the time I left was superb.  I had a few special requests prior to my arrival that guest services handled impeccably. The property and staff are wonderful.  Everything has its place and is well maintained.    The rooms are roomy and the bay view room with walk out patio was awesome.  Service and cleanliness are my staple requirements and for that this resort property receives 5 stars.  For example, I had dinner at two of the three restaurants (Simply Grills and Wan Hao).    It is hard to describe just how good the food was here but I will try.

All the staff have done all they can to make our stay as comfortable as possible and the room we stayed in which had a patio bay view was clean and comfortable.

The waiters substandard for a  5 star resort, lucky it was a buffet or else we would have to wait the whole night. The salad variety was good, the pumpkin, sprouted bean with prawns, etc the deserts okay , a mix of Indian n western.  The food was disgusting, bassa fish is termed as bakhi and the waiter said that it was not bassa,  mutton stew was unappetising  on the whole below standard.

I would like to thank ""Lohit"" from the breakfast restaurant for always welcoming us with a warm smile and ""Abhijeet"" from the front desk for helping is with plan our Goa stay.    Negatives-  1. The staff at the pool area can be a bit annoying. They told my cousin not to use her camera in the pool area and then after a few hours we saw a few guests using their cameras in their presence.

We are back at home yet we cannot stop talking about how wonderfully they treated us.  I am visiting the Goa Marriott after exactly a year. I was there last year for my honeymoon and now we went back to celebrate our first year anniversary.  We enjoy fishing more than anything else. What was a real surprise was that, the staff remembered us! Philip and Xavier– you are just incredible. You remembered each and every wish and like of ours from our previous stay. THANK YOU!!!

"As we were planning to celebrate our 2nd marriage anniversary, we decided to stay at this resort. As our expectations it turned out a very calm and but yet very energising resort. It had all what we wanted, a beautiful room with a look over the beach, a quite beach, good food, nice staff and big pool. We were quite surprised too in a sense we didnt knew that such nice resort exist in the middle of panaji. We were overwhelmed by the hospitality of the staff. The design of the property was good too as it was a  combination of modern yet with antique art. Sitting beside pool and watching  small boats and yatches go by was so rejuvinating.

"This hotel was great. We were looking for something with a view, but not on the main beach. This was located close to the town, and also only 30 minutes to the churches that one would want to visit when there. The lobby is amazing, and the person who checked us in was very efficient and helpful. Some of the rooms can be a bit of a walk from the lobby, but we had a great view. The rooms were nice, but note that the smoking/non-smoking is by room, and not by floor. So, you could be in a non-smoking room, but next door to smokers. This was the case with our 2 rooms. We didn't smell the smoke in the rooms, but walking through the halls, and when their door was open, there was a lot of cigarette smoke to be had. Overall, a wonderful place and would definitely return.",Date of stay: February 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The property beside the river Mandovi was a great one and the rooms were spacious, clean and with all the modern amenities. The iron and the iron board are worth mentioning. Also, the wifi was really great. The service, on the other hand was not the best as they really took long time to provide me the crib for my infant and also when I asked for 2 glasses of hot milk for the baby, I expected approximately 400-500 ml of milk.

We arrived at the hotel at around 3:30 pm and noticed that there was a through cleaning of the porch with a jet spray in progress. I am not sure why this was not done in the night like other hotels do when traffic is the least.

There are exceptional views of the beach from the hotel lobby and the pool deck, restaurants that serve the most delicious food and a fantastic spa and gym! The hotel staff were exceptional, especially Vinod (the hotel manager) and Delilah. Not only did they go above and beyond in providing the best service possible, but they also spent a considerable amount of time interacting and engaging with my family during our stay at the resort.

"This large resort hotel is situated fairly close to Panaji center, next to Miramar beach. We had a lovely six night family holiday here. Do not choose this property for its beach location as Miramar beach is one of the poor ones (red flag) except that from this beech boat rides for dolphin watch leave (noisy with loud bollywood music). Hotel is fairly large and some rooms are better than others. So do see the room before accepting it. Sea facing rooms with balcony are probably best. Furniture and decor are a bit tired and updating is required. Our room had cracked tiles on floor and chipped marble coffee table. It also had sharp edge on shower cubicle (chipped glass).

"The Goa Marriot is an excellent hotel.  It’s a safe-bet that you’ll have a good experience here.    Check-in was very smooth.  Subhanjana showed me right to the room, I relaxed on the couch with a beer while she completed the check-in, answered my questions, ensured I got online, etc.    The cleaning staff is hard-working, dedicated, and helpful.  Special thanks to Urmila, who helped me find the room on day 2.  (It’s a big hotel.)    The Goa Marriot’s reception lounge is legendary amongst Goans.  A great place to relax and watch the sunset.    Breakfast is good, including the coffee.  Dinner on the wharf is also good, I recommend the snapper & grilled vegetables.    You are about 1 mile from downtown Panaji.

"A beautiful luxurious place with impeccable service.  Surpisingly our experience here didn't start well. Noone paid attention when we reached. Valet behaved strangely and said you can park the car yourself if you want. However the team at reception welcomed us warmly. Each one of them was very hospitable.  There was a confusion with the booking. We were using marriott's android app to track our reservations and it showed a booking for bay view room. While checking in we realized that the booking was refreshed to garden view. Though the hotel accepted this as a s/w glitch we were somewhat disappointed.  We were charged INR 2000 a night extra for adding breakfast and happy hours(5-7 pm), which they graciously waived later :)  The next day their customer service manager listened to…",Date of stay: January 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

"Marriott is a place where one can easily feel relaxed and royal. Excellent services, Friendly Folks & Cleanliness to the core.  The Seaview rooms are just excellent as you wake up to the sound of waves. A walk by the sea is so refreshing and much needed to our busy routines.  Food spread was vast and covered many cuisines. Tasty and splendid variety on the breakfast buffet.   The pool is lovely to swim or sit by its side as it gives a breathtaking view of the pool and the sea.  I enjoyed the jacuzzi & spa services at Marriott. It is great to pamper our body with the most needed massage and jacuzzi and it feels great.

However, the hotel itself is looking a little tired now and lacks the sharpness of a five star hotel. With this in mind, I was not happy with my room and made this clear on my arrival. I was soon changed room and the next day offered an upgrade.  What makes this hotel 5 stars primarily are the staff.

The lobby is stunning and the hotel in general is well-kept, with very comfortable and spacious rooms (enormous beds), prompt housekeeping and a very nice swimming pool. The food at breakfast and in the restaurants was generally good and the staff were all friendly. Unfortunately many of them - the majority in fact - are in dire need of proper training, particularly in the pool area and breakfast.

"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The management team in this hotel are INCREDIBLE. From the moment you arrive and are greeted at the door/lobby, they go out of their way to make sure everything is 100% perfect, each one remembering your name and being friendly and helpful at all times. The standard of service is higher than many of their sister chain- the Ritz Carlton- yes, they really are excellent! It is hard to single out people as all are so professional and nice- but the Front Desk Manager deserves a mention, he is just so delightful and professional (he has also worked at the JW Marriott in Mumbai which is also one of my favourite hotels and a hotel which equally focuses on service).

If you are a Gold member, it is also very close to the lobby bar where you can get free snacks and tea/coffee as a membership perk and sit watching the sea from above. The manager was awesome and let me stay in my room much longer when I was checking out since I had a late flight.  Not only did he offer to let me stay later, he made sure that I was taken care of for the duration.

Also its located at the confluence of the Mandovi river and Arabian sea and you get lovely views of the sea. There is also a small private beach which then connects to Miramar beach.  Now coming to service, the beauty of it lies in the details and small gestures which the entire hotel staff took good care of. From knowing our names just as we stepped in(we had Airport pick and drop included) to the towel Animals made for kid daughter to the service we received at the restauraunt.  The staff was always very friendly, polite and helpful.  The kids room and small play park is a good distraction for the kids. Food was good and had a good variety.

The breakfast is pretty standard fare. However, the live counters add a lot of variety. Try their eggs benedict - I was a big fan - if only I had discovered it sooner..

In case you are looking for a place away from the city and on the beach for relaxing , then this is not the place. Located in the city of Panjim , facing the Mandovi river . You have to reach there while passing through the narrow street of Panjim ( Bad Road) . Though the property is build very nicely. Food experience was good with a good variety  but the waiters are lost. May time they had taken order and delegated to others to expedite ( which was often mis communicated ). Also I had a bad experience both at checkin and also in the room. I was running late for my meeting and found the hot water was not working.

"Stayed at the Marriott resort in August 2015 for 3 days for a wedding. We were picked up from the airport and transported to the hotel without any problems. The drive was about 1:30 hours. Checking in was smooth and quick and we were given a warm welcome. Staff in general are very efficient and polite. We were shown into what I think is an annex of the hotel as the resort was fully booked. The room we stayed in was damp and when I brought this up with maintenance, some adjustments were made to the air-conditioning. This did not make any difference though.But the room was quite spacious, bed comfortable and had a reasonable view of the beach.

"Of all the places I have stopped in, the staff here have to be one of the most professional and serviced focused I've seen. Without being pushy or annoying, the balance was great. The adjoining rooms we had were of very good quality, with a nice view over the bay. Although it was monsoon season, at night we managed to sit out on the terrace. An umbrella or awning to stop us getting wet would have been nice, but we never. The range of food was excellent. Whilst we were there, the theme was different states each night. Each was to a very good standard. There is a children's play room that has daily activities, as well as a good outdoor pool. It is quite a drive from the airport, so if you are connecting into Goa from outside India, that may be the only downside.",Date of stay: August 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Resort Feel. Lots to do around it too like a local. If you are looking for a stay at a resort in Goa and yet be in the middle of the city. It has to be at JWM. Located in Panjim you can get the feel of Goa city as well as enjoy the Marriot Hospitality. Rooms are very nice. Special mention are the ones which are sea facing. Sea is not much to talk about.

"If it weren't for a signboard to the left, driving by old houses and neighbourhood, one would expect a guest house. The Goa Marriott isn't a very large property. The lobby is small and right at the entrance. But the view from the lobby is the best I've seen in any, in Goa. Huge view of the sea, with comfortable chairs and tables to look from. The rooms are big, comfortable and offer great views as well. The beds aren't tucked in, which make sleeping a breeze. They have multiple phones like all hotels, but the phones aren't synced. One can't answer a call from the nearest phone but from a specific phone. The bathrooms welcome you with pretty roses on towels, which you don't want to disturb.

Service is excellent - I really appreciated the folks that service my room - always impeccably clean. The resort is kind of limited with a pool. Unfortunately, the beach has a lot of trash and I wouldn't take a chance swimming in the sea here because of the trash and the river (this is India so no knowing the E.coli count). The food and served were excellent and not too overattentive as is sometimes the case in India. The downsides are that from a US perspective, Panjim, the town where the resort is located is sort of run-down and there is trash everywhere.

However, the first sight you get immediately upon entering the reception area allays all your doubts and fears. You get a view of the sea immediately when you get to the entrance.  The swimming pool is located right at the beach and poolside bar has a nice ambience. There is also a seating area next to the pool where the hotel can make arrangements to serve you an exclusive meal.

The breakfast buffet is nice with a few variations everyday. We had 3 rooms and 1 suite booked very recently. The welcome drinks are awesome - BEERS - shows you are in Goa. The staff is courteous and welcoming. Pool bar is one of the excellent things here with pool overlooking the pvt. beach. Nice property overall, but rooms are a bit oddly designed with much longer lengths than widths. Seems clumsy(for a 5 star) when you begin to spend a little time there.

Stayed recently at the hotel for 4 nights (split into 2 trips). I have been to the hotel many times in the past as well. The rooms and services are definitely a notch above what I expected. On both the visits the check-in was very very smooth. The room was ready and I was whisked away and was in the room within minutes. The front desk was very efficient in this. We ate the restaurant couple of times. Both times we asked for the special fish curry. I must say I have eaten around in Goa but the fish curry that the chef made for us was exceptional. Very very satisfying. The breakfast spread is large and caters to one and all. This is to be expected at a full service Marriott.

"The Goa Marriott is a beautiful hotel, and quite worthy of the Marriott name.  However, the town of Goa is spread out and uninteresting. There is not a whole lot near the Marriott although you can walk to a small market area. In order to get to the REAL beach, you must hop a bus and/or trek.  There is a small beach outside the hotel, but it's not quite nice enough to be tempted away from a nice hotel pool. The rooms are large and well appointed and customer service is Marriott quality.

About 100 rooms were booked and it would have been challenging to arrange under any given circumstances since half the folks were from UP and the rest from interior TN.   The hotel had perfect pick up and stop arrangements for people arriving by plane or by train. The check in was flawless. Yes, the place is do full that if you arrive early, you may have to wIt a bit. The waiting isn't boring. Enjoy the stupendous view from the lobby or walk over to the beach.   The rooms are okay. Not the most comfortable I have been in but decent.

"We have been coming to Goa for the last 20 years or so once every year. Sometimes even twice. We have stayed at various hotels before. Both higher end and budget.   We decided to try the Marriott this time. And it looks  like we will never look anywhere else for a long time to come.   Amazing views. Amazing food. In Goa, in a 5star property that goes without saying.   But at the Mariott, above all, the most striking difference is its courteous and involved crew.   The leadership shines through till the last man on the last rung.   Of the many warm smiles and bright faces, we will remember Mr. Subhajit and Ms Subhanjana at the front desk and Mr. Azim in the restaurant. These are the people who went out of their lines to make our stay more pleasant.   Will return. For sure",Date of stay: June 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The property is Centrally located at the MiraMar beach. The breakfast lunch and dinner buffet were great. A huge spread of dishes from a wide variety of cuisines and a long spread of desserts which my son loved.  Facilities like fitness centres, kids play area, pool , whirl pool and spa and fishing made my stay quite pleasant and interesting.  i would like to suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury yet enriching experience. …",Date of stay: May 2015,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Rooms itself are tastefully done .  Only thing we didnt like was the noise in the resort..as there was some seminar going on there was too much nuisance.  The Marriot restaurant on the riverside is a must,try if you visit this property.You choose your fish and they cook it for you.

Resort is located at the end of river where river merge in to the sea. This give good view to the eyes but you can't swim in the water due to depth and traffic of boats and ships. However If you are in Goa,  you would like to stay on the beach resort instead of the river side or city. To me if you are looking to enjoy and explore Goa beaches this is not the right location.

Very Polite, courteous and they go out of the way to help the guests.  Special call out to the Front desk and the Bar Staff.

Right on the beach front, yet 5/10 mins car ride to do some local shopping and even faster in a rickshaw.......the only way to travel in India :)  Our holiday got off to the perfect start even before we got to Goa, this was due the interaction of their front office manager Ashwin during our booking process.

The hotel itself is very nice, even if the access road to it is a little surprising (the last couple of blocks look like you're in the middle of a very residential area with narrow dirt roads and cars blocking the way).

Every single detail was spot on.   My pet hate when arriving at a hotel is the check in. You may have been on a flight for hours or had an early morning flight, the last thing you want to do is hang around a desk for ten minutes filling in small pieces of paper work.

This is not a 5 star property! I normally dont write reviews but this place was just too terrible!  -The pool and lounge area are dirty and everywhere smells like fungus.  -We found a huge cockroach in our bathroom (picture available!) and hotel staff thought its not a big deal! - We had to wait for a table for breakfast for around 15 minutes. Ordered eggs and had to wait another 30 minutes and thsn just when we finished they asked us to leave the restaurant cause they needed to get ready for brunch!

"The Goa Marriott Resort & Spa is a dream destination for anyone wanting a peaceful holiday at a Beach Resort. The Marriott is a 5 * property situated just 5-6 kms from the Capital City Panjim and boasts a private beach along the Miramar Bay. It has a choice of well appointed rooms, most having a view of the sandy beach and the sea. The food is excellent--starting with a kingsize breakfast at the Waterfront Terrace- a choice of Continental, American and Indian treats- followed by a hearty princely lunch in a few hours   at the same location. For dinner one can choose from a quiet meal at the Chinese Restaurant or a sumptuous steak at the Grille or the traditional buffet at the Terrace cafe.

"Situated in the heart of Goa (Panaji), Marriott lives up to its name perfectly. The approach to the hotel is the only ""Non Marriott"" like with a narrow alley leading up to the entrance. But once  there the apprehension are all gone, the first view from the lobby is breathtaking with the  Mandovi River joining Arabian Sea. Located on the Miramar Beach, the hotel actually overlooks the exact portion of the confluence of the River with the sea. The hotel rooms are nice and airy and uncluttered, infact they are really king sized. The rooms include two queen sized beds adequate if you are ravelling with family and do not want to hire another room. Try and get the sea facing for obvious reasons.

Luckily I had my meds with me, but I lost a good 2 days of my vacation. That being said, the staff was great. Food was quite good - the stuff I kept down anyway :/, and there was enough to do to keep my husband occupied while I was praying to the porcelain gods.   I do wish the beach and pool area were a little larger and more user friendly. The beach doesn't really look like the photos and was too dirty for swimming.

"Reading many positive reviews of the Hotel, I decided to visit Marriott for Valentines Day celebration with my wife. Stayed at Marriott for four days stay. Welcome staff was courteous and check-in process was quick. Disappointing aspect was inspite of requesting for ground level room, we were given first level room. Room was nice and spacious with all necessary amenities. Bathroom is also quite spacious and clean. As regards food, the menu in buffet was more or less same type and quite monotonous.

"Great hotel, right on the water with its own beach.  Built in the Portugese style only a few years ago with Spanish tile and large buildings, it also has a small ruin of an ancient Portugese church on the grounds.   Swimming pools are excellent.  Drivers will take you anywhere and wait for you at fair cost, including beaches, downtown, the old Portugese Fort, and shopping for the day, and they are waiting for you at the Goa airport (brand new) when you arrive.  They had first rate service when I realized I lost my ATM card as well.  Easily recommend.

On enquiring, I was informed that the hotel co-ordinator asked the doors to be locked for all guests attending the conference. I cannot help but wonder at how arbitrarily it has been done. I know that the mini-bar services need to be paid for, and it is obvious that the bill can be settled while checking out.

He even made us a sea food dish at night because we didn't make the afternoon sea food promotion open buffet.  One observation though! The hotel needs an upgrade since it looked a bit dated.  All in all, highly recommended for the family.",Date of stay: October 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"In my opinion due to it's location on the beach and at the same time within walking distance from Goa's interesting capital Panaji, and also a short drive from beautiful Old Goa. I stayed at Marriott for the second time, six years after my first stay and found that the good first impression from last time was exceeded this time around. The hotel is well maintained and its staff service minded and welcoming. There may be other resorts in Goa that looks more tempting online, and have better beaches, but then check out their location if you also want to experience Goa",Date of stay: October 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"Stayed in Marriott in Sep 2014 on two day office offsite.It's a nice spacious property overlooking the sea but cannot boast about a private beach , whatever little beach they have along side their property is not very clean and waters are deep so you cannot really enjoy the beachy side of Goa here.The swimming pool overlooking the sea & a pool pub is appealing.The restaurants specially breakfast is good.I splurged and got a spa done which was quite soothing & relaxing , if you are going to be in the resort and not planning to travel within Goa then you must invest time & money in their spa.

"Hotels like these need no reviews for a decision to be taken whether to stay here or not. If you can stay here, you should! And hence this review is more about what to do when you are here. The hotel lives up to its standards and expectations so not much complaints here!   1. Get up early, hit the beach as this hotel is right next to one. Or better be in the pool and enjoy the view of the beach! Its nicely located 2. Eat a lavish breakfast here at The Waterfront. Not much needs to be said on how big and awesome these buffets are. 3. In case you missed the awesome breakfast, have an awesome lunch. They do an awesome job here! 4. Hit the GYM : Full fledged gym is available at the hotel.

"Stayed here for two days on a business trip.I admit I can be picky it comes to hotels, I spend enough time in them.   This place is basically fine but needs a bit of a rocket from the management. The standard of cleanliness is not at all disgusting, but below what one might expect.   Dusty room, Buffet hot food worryingly cold. Scuffed walls. For the price I paid, I guess it's not bad but below par for the Marriott brand.   Panaji itself is pretty filthy, as is the beach backing onto the property (and I have spent years in India).   I gave it 3 stars but I can't believe there are not better places for the money. Food is ok, a visually impressive buffet let down by bland,  'samey' curries.",Date of stay: October 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
This is one of the best places to stay in Goa. Was there on a family holiday and had a perfect vacation. The hospitality extended is beyond comparison. We had BHUSHAN from housekeeping do these beautiful toys out of the hotel linen everyday..simply amazing. Front office team of Sanket and Pradeep were extremely helpful at 3:00am when my husband fell ill..they walked us to our room and even did a follow up call next day to enquire about his health. Delicious food and very good service .  A special thanks to the F&B team for sending sweets on Dusherra along with a greeting card.

"This hotel stood out for its outstanding customer service: Elizabeth's classy direction left its stamp on all the personnel, of whom I would pick out Vanessa at the desk, Neha as restaurant manager, and chef Samantha. (Perhaps it isn't a coincidence that all these are ladies!). I was warmly welcomed and any niggles I had were quickly ironed out -- and this quality of error correction is precisely what is so rare in today's crassly commercial world, what made this Marriott stand out as a stellar exception.  I was delighted with my room, and Chef Samantha's culinary creations brought Goa alive on my tongue. I was left feeling that the hotel staff were so much classier than some of their guests, whose noise and lack of manners were the only black spots in an otherwise perfect stay.",Date of stay: October 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Secondly, although this may be the best hotel in Panjim, it is about 12 years old and definitely does not feel as new and luxurious as it does on the photos. 12 years ago it must have been a good one, but now it does not feel equal to the newer 5* hotels in India.

The hotel is walking distance from the city - so we took a few walks to the restaurants and shops in Panjim.  The staff bent over backwards to take care of our needs.  Other people have commented on the great food but the pastry chef needs a special mention.  She is awesome.  Made some special croissants and couple of other items and it was out of this world.  If you are into spas, please visit the one on this property.  You will not be disappointed.

Once I reached Bangalore from Goa, I called the manager up and pointed out the mistake, and then promised that they will work on it. It's been couple of months and I haven't heard from them.

A special mention for the team at the Waterfront Cafe - chef Manish, chef Nithin, simao were great with the kids. Since it was raining and we couldn't step out, they offered to make Goan specialities off the menu for us, and always wanted to know what they could bring for the kids.

The structure of the place is such that you dont get disturbed by noisy neighbours and working staff. Helps you to sleep in if you want to. Would also suggest the all-meals plan.

"My husband usually books in a Marriott, wherever possible, so we usually know what to expect in one. My first glimpse of the property was beautiful...A huge, open lobby area overlooking the Bay...We were escorted to the room and the check in process was done there, rather than at the Reception. To be honest, my first impression of the bathrooms wasn't that great...but its obvious that Marriott has taken over an old property and turned it into something Charming, so one can overlook small things...and the Bay View makes up for everything!!

Marriott took care of us totally from the time we landed at the airport till we were safely back in the airport for our return flights. We were met at the airport with packed lunch boxes for the convenient 45 minute ride to the hotel. The meeting room was arranged with all necessary tools like projector, whiteboards, notepads etc with tea coffee and delicious snacks on tap.  In the evening we enjoyed the grill and buffet with fun games organised by the friendly Marriott team by the beachside.

No one was around to check if everything was ok during our breakfast or lunch..... They have a pool bar, and the service was more horrible....

"This review of mine has been overdue for a couple of months. We spent three nights at this lovely resort during the last week of March. I had accumulated a significant number of nights at various Marriott properties, thanks to my work related travel. As a result of that, I had sufficient Marriott reward status to get automatically upgraded to suite on check in. On arrival at the airport, we had a private car waiting for us to get picked up. Check in at the hotel was in suite and we didn't need to wait at the reception. During check in, my 3 year old was given a smiley mug. Basically, all that was needed is to carry the cup to any restaurant and the kid get unlimited refills of juice. I thought that was pretty cool idea.

The staff was very helpful and the pool and poolside bar and restaurant buffets were very nice! Our only regret was that we didn't realize that this hotel is not on one of the nicer beaches of Goa and is on the river draining into the ocean. As the result the beach is almost unusable. We walked on the beach but could not go in the water and despite the fact that there are people cleaning the beach regularly, it just isn't the nicest beach.

The staff were fantastic as usual and the Food fantastic. I think next time I'm in Goa I would love to stay here again.It is placed well in the city and is easily accessible to the hot spots..

The rooms were spacious and clean the only problem being that we were in a room over the gardens where weddings/birthdays were celebrated, these functions were very noisy but thankfully finished at approx 10.30pm. The beach near the hotel wasn't brilliant but there was plenty of space around the pool.  We didn't use the spa or the gym but apparently they were good.

I have rarely seen a hotel staff so nice! Restaurants are great : you will enjoy whatever you have breakfast, lunch or dinner. Most of dishes are indian or indian-inspired, but continental food is also available. Location is convenient, in Panaji. You can consider to have a walk from the hotel and go to downtown. The beach is the only weak point : Miramar beach does not have the appeal of southern beaches in Goa.

The dinners and lunches we had were very ordinary. Oily food with very ordinary taste. The fish curry on one of the days was made with Bassa like fish and not one of the good sea fishes that can be found in decent Goan restaurants.   The Swimming pool is nice but is not very large.

"You know my favorite holidays in Goa have been the ones where I did nothing but just soaked in the atmosphere. The absolutely unhurried pace of life.  The trouble with most 5 star properties in Goa is that while they build a 5 star in Goa, they leave Goa out. Marriot is such a place. It ticks all the boxes, pool, bar, lounge, gym play area, restaurants a strip of the beach as well. Yet somehow it lacks the warmth and ease of Goa.  The rooms are clean , decent, food is nice, the play area surprisingly lacks attention, they have one or the other weddings happening at one time or the other.

"To begin with, we must say that we've stayed at several resorts in Goa, but the view from the rooms and the pool area, etc., is one the better ones we've enjoyed. Therefore, we found the hotel to be a very relaxing sojourn for us. Having said that, this isnt one of the largest resorts in Goa and probably so because of its location in the city.   We were a bit disappointed with the services level and the food. We made the mistake of taking a package which had all meals included thinking we would just lounge around the resort and not have to step a foot out. But the food just didnt hit the spot. For example, there were hardly any traditional Goan preparations over the course of the stay.

Our double room (bay view) was spacious and very comfortable, same goes for the bathroom with separate shower and tub. Plenty of clean, lovely towels and linnen.

The staff are all very helpful. The food is wonderful in all the restaurants and we don't think £10 plus taxes for a brilliant steak in Simply Grills is expensive.  The restaurant overlooks the sea. Evenings only.  We weren't sure if Goa was for us but this bit certainly is.   There are some bedrooms that do not have a balcony so if this is important to you, book one, We are on the ground floor and have a terrace with 2 sun loungers.  Perfect for watching the sun go down. All the boats pick up people to go and see the Dolphins etc, from the beach so it can sometimes be a bit noisy but for us it added to the…",Date of stay: March 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

We spent two weeks at the beginning of March at the Marriot. For us it was just an opportunity to crash out after a busy period and to escape a wet and windy UK. We were greeted with smiles at reception at 1am on the day of our arrival. The staff realised the need to deal with the registration process quickly and within minutes we were escorted to our room.

I stayed on a bed and breakfast basis, breakfast was extensive, everything was there that you could wish for except for crusty fresh rolls ( being European it is unusual to only have toast for breakfast and I would have liked a choice of different types of bread). All the services ie. restaurant, housekeeping, reception, pool were excellent. The hotel is 3km outside of Panjim.

Spa services were nice and fairly affordable. Room cost  was fairly high as I paid $300/night even with MMF (marriott friends and family), and the food was exorbitant in the seafood restaurant ($150 usd Dinner for 1). Good buffet though for lunch/dinner at the continental restaurant.",Date of stay: January 2014,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"I stayed in Marriott last year and some how missed reviewing it. The good part is that I clearly remember my stay given that the the customer service was so good. I stayed in a garden facing room (clearly not a good choice) but the room was very plush. I have stayed in Leela Goa and Taj Holiday village and I must say that the room at Marriott was better than Taj (but not better than Leela  - only in terms of space). It had 2 beds (queen size) so it you are traveling with kids, this is the best option for you. The swimming pool is much bigger that what it looks in the photos and a lot of people in the pool would also not be discourage you from jumping right into it.

There is no free wifi which is weird but I've understood this is common Marriott policy.  The hotel is about 5-10 minutes taxi drive from the Panjim city center. Very easy to walk also, takes about 25 minutes.  If yo dont want to go to town, try Mum's Kitchen near the hotel (5 min valk). It's a bit pricey but rewarded restaurant with delicious food.

I personally researched several and the Marriott was the clear winner--location and amenities suited to our visit.

5 star accommodation with fabulous views of the sea with luxury rooms. The area is pretty rubbish and no where to walk to locally but if you are happy to stay in the hotel and use the facilities then it's a lovely place to be. The downside of the hotel was actually the other guests! There are a lot of wealthy Indians who stay here and treat the staff as their personal slaves and seem to think they do not have to consider any other guests with their loud and arrogant behaviour. They have a lot of weddings here this time of year and the guests are also not very pleasant either. Wifi is free but a little unreliable at times but staff are always willing to help.

The beach view is very delightful and you can access the beach with just a casual stroll down from the hotel.

"To begin with, this isn't a beach resort. Its at the junction of the Mandovi River, and the Ocean, so its more of a bay view. Like most things there are two sides to the story. The fact that it isn't a proper beach, makes the waterfront very quiet and serene. That's the good part. The Hotel Lobby has a spectacular view, as do the bay view rooms so I would make sure to get a room with the view. Good for a business visit, not so great for a holiday in terms of location, as this is neither on the quiet and sprawling beaches of the south, nor in the hub of the action in the north.  The Spa is very good, as is the gym despite its size. The equipment is really very good. The Pool is a little small for the size of the hotel but is constantly buzzing with guests.

Located on the beach where the sea and river meet, so there are fishing boats and other vessels coming and going and in their wake the Dolphins sometimes follow.  This can all be viewed from the comfort of your sun lounger by the pool. There are no loungers on the beach and the sea is not inviting.

"We booked in what was considered a low season, but the hotel was full. The room and service and location were fantastic. However, the beach off the hotel property was badly maintained, and was not ideal for children at all. But the pool area and the children's play area were all great. The poolside grill has fantastic food, but it's highly over-priced.",Date of stay: August 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Good location and the span of the beach works in favor of the property.  However, it lacks the gradeurness of a otherwise available 5 star properties of Goa.  The swimming pool is rather unexciting, but the the beach spanning the curving beach...You often see rusted carriers traveling across the waters with coal/iron ore, not a site one enjoys on a repetitive basis on a holiday.  Staff is very hospitable and helpful.

As with all hotels there are good and bad. But despite some bad points the Goa Marriott managers and team managed to make our stay very special.  General tip When you are having a full day in the hotel check out the deals for the azure package. Free coffee and soft drinks all day. From 6pm till 8pm there is a small buffet selection and free alcoholic drinks..We did save quite a bit of money on this deal. A great way for the hotel to encourage guests to stay in.  Room tip Pay the extra and get a bay view. The view is just amazing day and night.Day ospreys fish outside your room. A great vista of the bay and the sea..Night. the lights of the fishing boats and party boats give an amazing show.

Great property - even though it is on the smaller side the location on (central goa) and by a quiet river opening into the sea is great. You really dont need a room just lounge by the pool or in the lobby!  The sunset is best watched from the lobby or your room balcony - but what ever you do dont miss that! Sip a drink while doing that ....  Having said that the rooms are not necessary they really are greatly appointed and spotlessly clean.   The staff are great and friendly and ever accomodating. The restaurants and lounge is great. The breakfast buffet offers a wide selection of food with really nothing at all missing.   Oh another must do is to enjoy an early morning cup of chai in the balcony enjoying the sunrise.  While you are there also enjoy the Spa - supremely relaxing.…,Date of stay: December 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The views across the estuary and the sunsets never failed to disappoint. The food was fantastic, we ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night as we'd traveled for 24 hours and it was fantastic. Breakfast was great with something for everyone, the chef would wander past and ask you if there was anything that could be done better!! The snacks from the poolside bar were equally scrummy.

Firstly, this is not a beach resort, its by the BAY. the views are stunning - almost 360 degree views of the bay. This is the speciality of the lobby area.  The rooms are excellent, especially the bay view rooms. being a platinum guest, I got an upgrade to bay view from a garden view room. if you are lucky, you can ask for those bay view rooms that are there on the main block. this has a straight view of the bay than the other blocks that have a balcony which has a partial view of the bay.

You drive up a circular drive and the entry overlooks the pool and beach beyond.  There is brief security for you and your bags each time you arrive.  Check in was good and I was upgraded to a waterfront room.  The good news is you can walk out onto the beach with nice, cushioned lawn chairs.  The bad news is that you need to keep your curtains closed unless you want everyone staring into your room.  The room itself was ok.  The bath had a separate tub and shower but seemed a bit grimy.

About the resort, its reasonably well maintained, good breakfast spread, excellent service and a nice pool with a swim-up bar. The let down is the room size, i thought it was pretty compact.

Special thanks to Stanley our Housekeeper that made swans and hearts with the towels each day the room was cleaned. The hotel has a swim up bar, poolside restaurant that specialises in seafood which was really nice and the main restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and tea has excellent choice for all three options.

"We went to the hotel to meet a friend at the Film Bazzar which is part of the International Film Festival of Inda held in Goa. We were immediately welcomed by one of the staff. We asked about our friend who was running a Master Class and the member of staff again was very helpful. We waited in the lobby and enjoyed the view across the River Mandovi. There were many people there enjoying the realxed atmosphere of the hotel and the facilities. I was very impressed by the situation, the staff and the amenities. It is only a short drive into town and very close to Kala Academy and the Inox cinema.

"My boyfriend recently had to move back to India due to visa issues, so this was my first time coming to goa to visit him. After reading countless reviews on different hotels, this one by far was the best one. Hotel was amazing, staff were very very friendly and made you feel like you were the only one staying in the hotel. Rooms cleaned everyday and fresh sheets were put on if asked. Every time we went out and came back again, there would be some sort of shape, like a swan or heart formed with a towel, a really nice touch and made you feel welcome. Most nights my boyfriend and I would sit in the lobby or pool area and watch the sunset. You can see the whole horizon as the river is right in front of the hotel. Breathtaking views.

We recommend to visit Old Goa, Baba beach, and take the boat to go for a trip on the sea.  Not sure when the boat leaves, but it is on the beach close to the hotel.

First time we`ve experienced this, but it made us feel very safe! The guards were smiling, polite and professional, and the bell boys immidiately took our bags, to the x-ray machine and kept them until we had checked in.

He came to the guest tables to get feedback and when my partner mentioned that it would be great if there was dry muesli (instead or in addition to Bircher), he immediately organized some for him.

"This resort is one of the best near the city of Panjim. So for those of you yearning city life in the near vicinity, this may be your ticket. Service all throughout was super and as one would expect when staying at 5 star hotels/resorts in India. It boasts the best buffet breakfast in Goa serving Indian, Continental, and diet conscious foods with a huge counter of desserts…..all yummy! Being a critique and very opinionated about hotels, I have to admit I was very impressed. So even if you don’t opt to stay here, do consider having their buffet breakfast.

"We went there for my friend's birthday and stayed for 2 nights. The location is great, you can hear the sound of the waves since its located on the beach. My favorites about the resort are:   - the pool, you can see the beach from the pool itself since its more like an infinity pool though not exactly.  - the pool bar, sitting inside the water and enjoying the drinks is a different experience.  - the room and bathroom, very spacious rooms and comfy beds. The bathrooms are beautifully decorated by petals, very neat and clean.  -a sit out in the balcony.  -the cake shop is awesome.

"After coming to Goa the 10th time, we came to the Marriot for a wedding. Right in Panaji which is great for the people who want to be in and around Panaji. The hotel has a lot of rooms which are facing the sea and the garden. The garden rooms are quite boring which don't give any sort of view especially the rooms which are closer to the lobby where even the garden is blocked by the walls around.   The pool is fantastic due to the length of it. Also the view is mind-boggling where one can sit comfortably and watch the sun go down. This property is one of the few which have sea facing rooms and which actually give a complete view of the beach and the sea.

hi i stayed here for 2 nights 3rd sep to 5th sep 2013. am not trying to sound biased but marriott resort at panaji is not for families on vacation. there is nothing for the kids and families to look forward to at this resort and moreover no attention was paid to my kid an infant of 2 years for any requirements for breakfast or lunch etc....also the absence of a lifeguard when we were at the pool... nor were there any floats rings or toys to play in the swimming pool was also felt... the rooms are very nice but the garden facing rooms are of no use as you have come to a beach resort and nobody wants to view a garden while staying at a beachside resort.,Date of stay: September 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The chefs come to you personally to check if you are enjoying the meals and if you need anything  -- definitely something I've never experienced in all my travels so far!  The spa is great; there's a lovely pool; one can take leisurely strolls or just sit by the water. We did not venture out of the property during our entire stay!

It’s a beautiful property right on the Miramar Beach in Panaji, The rooms are beautifully done and are quite spacious. I stayed in the Garden view room as Ocean view was totally sold out that day. I would recommend Ocean view room anyday to garden view room. I loved the infinity pool of The Marriot which is bit small but beautiful.

"Since the first time I visited Marriot, the location definitely made an impression on me. The lobby opens to the sea and during the rains on an overcast afternoon, there are very few pleasures of life, which equate to being present there with some coffee and sandwiches.  The buffet was good, can be better, but scenic view from the lobby made my day.  Its a great place for solo travelers to speculate on possibilities, for couples to find themselves in an utopic land, and for families to have fun. I will definitely recommend an afternoon by the lobby, over some coffee, it's experiences like these, which amazes us at the infinity of the universe and removes the haze from the corners of our minds.",Date of stay: October 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

We arrived early and we were allowed to check in right away which was excellent. The room was very comfortable and clean and had extra towels and feather pillows as requested. The only comment here would be that the room sometimes smelt musky and damp but I think that it due to the humid weather at our time of visit.   We went on a bus tour from the hotel to old Goa.

I'm pregnant and the chefs cooked me whatever I felt like eating - from a spicy Thai curry to wheat pizza to a homestyle roti-dal-chawal meal. Their USP is ""what special can I do for you"" and they are constantly living up to this.  The hotel's location right on the sea is very attractive.

Besides, you can just sit there in the lobby, sip a drink and spend hours enjoying the breeze, chatting with friends or just gazing out.  The location of the property is excellent as it's very central with very close proximity to the Miramar beach. In fact, Marriott's has its own little beach alongside the property. The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are big with all the necessary amenities associated with all 5 star properties.   Kids will have a good time here. The swimming pool is fairly large with a separate little one for small kids. Apart from an outdoor…",Date of stay: February 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
I went for 2 night holiday with my son of age 11 yrs.We enjoyed completely.we did not move out of hotel.My son enjoyed swimming pool and kids room.In kids room they have games for all ages including latest play stations.air hockey etc.The rooms are good with see through bathrooms and an option of putting blinders.Beds in room are very comfortable.  The hotel has a good casino.   Location is good.Its close to main panaji and Inox theatre.   The buffet has a good spread.But the quality of food is only acceptable and not outstanding.

Absolute stunning location.although not facing the open sea or fancy beaches the mandovi river view makes up for a real mesmerising experience.at night you can see streamers with lights floating around in the mandovi river.you can spend the entire evening soaking in the pool.then warming yourself in the bars and restaurants.since it is located in prime area of the city you are in town within no time.old goa is closeby where there are a lot of heritage sights.all in all a good goa escape.only bad experience is during checkin for a group they looked terribly understaffed to handle a group and the welcome is quite cold and indifferent.the beach is just walking down the hotel paths.after dinner time can be spent soaking in the balmy evening breeze.,Date of stay: April 2013,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"I have always loved this hotel and this one in particular is close to my heart. The view from the lobby is one of a kind and the staff at the reception compliment the lobby with their polite/pleasant/warm welcome, always. It was a delight and an unforgettable stay. The breakfast buffet is a wonderful spread and service is exceptional. The staff, right from security to the waiters in the restaurant are completely in sync with their etiquettes and politeness. The sea food restaurant ""Simply Grills"" is top notch and you will not be disappointed one bit.

"We booked Marriott for last week of May 2013 and got the ground floor rooms facing sea. The view from the room was awesome. There is a sit out in front of the room facing sea. The rooms were spacious, especially the bathroom. One of the bathroom wall is glass and you can see how is taking shower while lying on the bed. There is a swimming pool which shares the edge with the sea beach. Its a fantastic location of swimming pool. My daughter loved swimming.  The food is bit expensive. Once we had ordered Chicken biryani and it cost Rs.900 and serves only one person. The quality  & quantity of biryani was not up to the mark.

The hospitality offered by the staff is also good but the problem lies in their breakfast and the swimming pool . Another incident which shook me - when we visited there were new chairs installed in the rooms which broke and one my family member got hurt , there was no proper first-aid or answer given to us which is a shame for the Marriott's . Also the elevators near the coffee shop appeared to be obsolete .  Otherwise the experience for me was just fine .",Date of stay: July 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Due to a major power outage one evening which, we were told, would not be rectified till morning, and due to the heat and humidity we decided to spend a night at the hotel despite the cost. The standard room allotted to us on the ground floor was nice enough, though the balcony which opened out to the lawns was not usable. The room was located quite far from the coffee shop, pool and reception area. The staff were quick to supply us with extra water and toilet supplies we asked for despite the lateness of the hour.

We were looking for a tranquil oasis with a beautiful sandy beach and regular yoga classes.There's where we got disappointed. The beach is small is public, and the pool unusable thanks to the policy of wearing caps (applies only to women) and no cotton tops in the pool bar. I got admonished twice and this discourages the possible relaxation... The staff try to be nice about that, but there is no way I am going to send my friends a picture of me in a cap under a palm tree... ;) .

The only disappointing thing about this hotel is their policy on women having to wear swimming caps in the pool.   When on a relaxing holiday it is very annoying being told to put a cap on ever time you go for a 5 minute dip. This complaint was handled very poorly by management as the response was, ""nothing we can do about it, that is the rule"".

"Have stayed here on several occasions. Just at the outskirts of the town proper, this luxe-resort is perched on the edge of the river estuary with a beautiful outlook (IF you splurge for a waterside room that is!!).  If you are here for pampering within the boundaries of your lodging and not particularly interested in ""beach shacks, rave parties or local sightseeing"", this place will do you very nicely. But it's a bit of a hike into the town central and not much of interest around it except a couple of other luxe-resorts.

It delivers in terms of what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The rooms were great - they are one of the few hotels that offer 2 x double beds in a room - which is great for our family. This means you are not forced to have a roll away bed, which takes more space away from the room as well.   The breakfast buffett was good as you had a fairly decent array of food catering to both Western as well as Indian diets.

Not the biggest pool i have seen but more than adequate for the number of people that were using it, the service from the pool bar was very efficient, all the hotel staff were very friendly and seemed eager to please. The SPA area was very nice too if not a tad on the expensive side for India.

Service has exponentially decreased .....that is the tip of the iceberg!! Last night, there was a puddle of water from the ac (our good luck ..that nobody slipped!) and the ac went off!!! and Goa was indeed v hot yesterday. The only compensation that they can think of...is a complimentary dinner!!!  Our room was dusty when we checked in and the dust was obvious on the dark wooded furniture.

SPA is very good, you can get cheaper outside the hotel walking distance, however no guarantee if the products used outside are any good, I would use the hotel SPA, as the staff are very nice, plush settings and time of much longer then outside SPA...OH whirl pool is free to use, not many know that ! we did not until a few days later, could have made better use of it.

We just stayed for 3 nights in February 2013. We were two couples essentially with our rooms being as far as almost 1.2 a km from each other :( distributed over two wings and one needs to take different lifts for different levels and a little walk to reach each other. Rooms are nice but balconies crammed up for space. One of the queen beds of the two in each room had a broken mattress that can cause one immense back ache by the time one wakes up early in the morning. Service is average with beverages (aerated drinks/sodas) being not only very expressive but ridiculouslycharged differently when taken from minibar or ordered from different sections of hotel.

Breakfast was provided daily and it is a spread of both western and indian breakfast. Pretty much the normal ordinary fare and nothing fancy. I ordered a beef burger for dinner one night and it kind of smelled horrible (quite stink) and awful to eat!  Everything is very spicy and hot so make sure to go slow on gravy or sauce.

I had a chance to visit this resort while participating in a conference. The property is built up in a very simple but elegant manner. The best part is the view from the lobby which is breathtaking; also something unique was that it was being cooled naturally by the cool air of sea. The rooms were also well maintained. The food was delicious and good in variety. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The only drawback which I felt is that it is not exactly a beach resort as swimming was not being advised there and if you are visiting a place like Goa and then have to travel some other place for bathing on a beach; then it is little inconvenient. Overall a very refreshing experience.,Date of stay: October 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

However.............the hotel is turning its back on the holiday maker now and looking for more conferences and weddings. In the two weeks we were there, there were five weddings, one of which was the prequel to the biggest wedding in Goa.

"I assume that most people visting Goa like myself, head there because it is a famous beach destination. If that is why you are visting Goa, I would advise that you avoid the Marriott.  While the property itself is good, great service (especially Lorraine at the reception), large bedrooms and bathrooms, fantastic SPA, all up to the Marriott standard, it is not situated on ''Miramar Beach'' as the website would suggest. It is instead situated on the banks of the Mandovi River with a short stretch of beach like riversand. Probably the worst ''beach'' in all of Goa.

"Great property with helpful, homely and friendly staff. Loved the attitude of the entire staff right from the time we checked in till checking out. Extremely cosy & comfortable rooms. The buffet breakfast spreads were also good and reasonably priced at approx Rs. 600/- per head. Beach is just across and quite clean. We had walks on the beach in the morning and it was quite peaceful with very few people.Seems like the beach is not safe for swimming as indicated by the red flags displayed by the life guards. We had an excellent holiday and will definitely come back.",Date of stay: November 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
We spent a wonderful 8 days at this beautiful hotel.From the moment we arrived we felt we had come to somewhere very special.Absolutely every member of staff went out of their way to ensure our every need was met.The spacious bedroom was immaculate and had a superb view over the bay. The smell of lemongrass in the corridors and bedroom was always so pleasant.So much so that we have come home and filled our house with this fragrance!

"We chose the Marriott in Panaji as a result if ""escaping"" from a disastrous rental villa in Candolim in Goa.....we heard on our first night in Candolim that there was a high incidence of thefts and violence on tourists and this concern about general safety was reinforced by a look Athens FCO web site where deaths of British citizens were reported.  Panaji and the Marriot therefore offered us safety and security. The rooms were delightful, modern and well appointed. It turned out to be a school holiday period when we were there and hence the pool area an the general Restsurant could and were somewhat noisy.

It was a horrible experience in all. Put at a table which was in total darkness 'the other tables with lights are booked'. Had to repeatedly ask for a menu and they brought a torch for us to read it. Kept pushing the wine menu at us. Waiters seemed harassed although gathered together in a group for most of the time. The food was truely awful, wrong sauces, wrong orders, wrong quantities and a superior, weary attitude. I don't believe that these staff have ever seen the inside of a training school.

How is it Kid-friendly, you ask? We have an 8 month old baby, and the hotel was kind enough to place a microwave in our room (on 1-days notice) so we could sterilize as needed. We also requested and got a crib at no extra charge - a Graco Park & Play crib.

The breakfast buffet has almost too much choice – whether it's English cereal and toast, European cold meats and cheese, American waffles or Indian dosa and uttapam that floats your breakfast boat. The rooms are generously proportioned with super efficient AC that offers a welcome relief from the heat and humidity in the middle of the day.

You express your wish and they will start working on making it true. We went during off season, so there were no great activities happening around but Goa is Goa..seasonality doesn't matter. Hotel is conveniently located near Miramar beach and chaupati is at just walkable distance where you can enjoy different local savouries in the evening. Hotel chefs do their best to offer you any dish irrespective of the fixed or buffet menu if you have not liked the choice of buffet menu.

Its merely 15Km drive form up North (Baga & Calangute) and you get to be closer to the Panjim market and some local shopping. Although the Miramar beach is not all that great, exactly y you wont come across many tourists there, but you can still enjoy the small beach which is just in-front of the Hotel. But for all beach enjoyment you will have to head to North. The hotel overall is nice, so are the staff.

"The day of departure coincided with a nationwide bandh, or protest, regarding the spike in petrol prices. All businesses shut down for the day along with taxis, buses, rail, etc. The airport opened around midday. The Marriott Goa arranged for a private bus with security to transport guests with flights departing that day to the Goa airport. The hotel was well prepared, taking into consideration that protesters were to block the only bridge in/out of Goa later in the day. The trip to the airport was uneventful and the hotel staff deserves much credit for handling the situation with ease.",Date of stay: May 2012,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Having stayed in hotels all around the world, I can say that Marriott Resort and Spa Goa truly lives upto the expectation. Located in the heart of Panaji, On Miramar beach, the property is located within a residential area, which makes the approach to the hotel a little tricky.  When checked in, we were greeted with a welcome drink (I asked for a second glass as well), the staff were courteous and polite with a smiling and cheerful face, the sort one likes to see after 3hours of flight. Their checkin time is 4pm and since we arrived at 1pm, our room wasn't cleaned and ready for us. Thus, we sat in the lobby overlooking the ocean and Miramar beach.

We were on a full board basis and the food was lovely, with plenty of choices and all cooked to a very high standard. The room was nicely decorated and was of a very good size and I have to comment about the bed, which was really comfortable. The views from our room were spectacular, just adding to the impressiveness of everything. The pool area was clean, well maintained and the sun remained around the pool area from mid morning onwards.

Absolutely blown away with the staffs attitude at the Marriott Goa. Constant smiling faces make this hotel a pleasure to stay in for a holiday. Nothing too much trouble for them and they go the extra mile to make sure you are assisted in every way. Booked a patio room overlooking Mandovi river. Bed was one of the most comfortable ever. Room spacious and bathroom with separate bath and shower great. Two sun loungers on patio make it special if you prefer quiet time to relax. Booked full board breakfast lunch and dinner food superb.

"Fantastic stay at the Goa Marriott over Christmas 2011 and New Year 2012. The staff are fantastic and go all out to help in any way. The hotel is central for North and South activities - with the help of the exceptional taxi drivers employed by the hotel. Only one suggestion and that would be to try and keep families with young children in one area/wing of rooms - just so that any problems with noise can be less frustrating for guests without children. Not all children are noisy we know, but there were a few who we had to ask to keep the noise down at 2am or worse. Otherwise a highly recommended place.",Date of stay: December 2011,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

The lobby and rooms do not have the  ""beachy"" atmosphere any longer but it is still very nice.  This year, stayed in a bay view patio room and that made it more special since there was no need to walk the halls to an elevator to get outside.  The food is excellent.  The breakfast buffet is great with an amazing number of choices (but the service can be a little bit erratic when full).

"If one just wants to relax and not hit the beach, then this is a great place. One can just sit by the pool side, eat, drink and enjoy the scenic bay view. It is very relaxing. However you want to be on the beach, then this hotel will not provide that. The little beach that is attached to this is nto clean and I really won't call it a beach either. It is a point for folks to get onboard a little boat to go fishing. If you are in Goa to just eat and relax, then request a room with bay view and a balcony. The food is average and then that is true for almost all the hotels and resorts in Goa. However snacks and finger food is good.

The resort lies at the secluded edge of the Miramar beach offering stunning views of the Arabian Sea. Located in the heart of Panaji. Goa Marriott Resort & Spa has its own digital casino and is a nice place for some nice small stakes fun betting. Their restaurant offers a vast variety of options in their lunch menu but the numerous gorgeous looking sweet-dishes are difficult to choose from and a heaven for the sweet-tooth!

No detail has been overlooked - from the crisp, bright white uniforms, to the sparkling clean hallways, to the genuine smile you receive from all who work here.

This is supposedly a 7 star. I would say its a five star and extremely nice. The reason being a 2 tar drop it would have been really nice to be able to extend onto the beach but unfortunately the hotel is built just down from the beach and on the river mouth so the water isn't that good quality. However the facilities and staff are really very helpful and efficient. There could be more options for travel to other beaches or sight seeing tours. Went on the Dolphin watch cruise and it was fun! very good rate  300 rupee for about 45 minutes. the pool is nice and the food is very nice.,Date of stay: December 2011,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"After having had a dreadful time at the Osborne Resort Hotel in Calangute, I decided to spend my last night in Goa at the Goa Marriott Resort & Spa in Miramar, near Panaji, to ensure my last night in Goa was a good one. I'd had lunch there a few days earlier and was very impressed by the hotel.  Its location is next to Miramar Beach, just north of Panaji, where the Arabian Ocean and the Mandovi River meet. You can see the beach from the pool side and can walk to the beach from the hotel, although I didn't go to there, as I was quite happy swimming in the lovely, hotel pool.

This is a lovely hotel that sits on the Mandovi river in Goa’s capital of Panjim. The hotel is in a good location for the city and it is very nicely decorated. Food and service is very good and the hotel is of a very good standard as you would expect from a Marriott hotel. This is not however what I would consider as a holiday hotel particularly for Goa as there is no beach and really it is more suited to the business traveller. When I stayed I was attending a conference and for our purposes it was excellent however if I was going on holiday I would stick to some of the more luxurious resort hotels out with the capital.

However, there are no indoor activities, a very small swimming pool and no access to private beach, which other hotels in goa have, of this category.   The restaurants are also limited in number and even during peak season, two were not functioning. The staff gave contradicting dates for the opening up of it.

Upkeep: Very well maintained: lobby, corridors, rooms. Not much of an expanse, unlike the large properties of South Goa. Small pool. Room service shows up twice a day and does a thorough job of cleaning up the room, a bit over zealous. Towels placed on the rack are always replaced.

Even the head Chef would talk to guests while they were having their meals and ask them if he could make something special for them in the buffet.

The beach is OK....not very sandy, and a little dirty, as its not private. But its fantastic non the less.  The food in the restaurants is spot on. The chefs will make you anything you like.

Watching right from your window the rain falling on ocean is something can't be described but only felt. However for water sport crazy person this may not be the right time to go there. We were on the 2nd floor of the hotel (top) the view from there was awesome. You can see the endless ocean right from your huge balcony glass door.  The staff overall was very humble and polite, except one or two which I think is ok. Room service was satisfactory. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the food, that may be due to our personal taste.

"My trip to the Goa Marriott was pretty much fly by night. I would remain at the client's office till late and come back to the hotel just to sleep. And if a hotel can ensure a proper night's rest and get you up and running early the next morning, you can be sure that its a good business hotel.  That is exactly what the Goa Marriott delivers. Around 30-45 mins from Dabolim Airport, its located on the outskirts of Panjim, right on the estuary of the Mandvi (Mandovi) River. As a result, you may not have a beach at your disposal, but the sight of a river flowing into the sea is a completely different experience- especially in the monsoons.

As we had stayed at The Goa Marriott Resort last year & had loved it we decided to book again for a two stay in March 2011. The travel agent we used were no longer offering this hotel as a package holiday so we booked our accommodation with one travel agency & our flights with another one. This meant transfers to the hotel were not included. Faced with trying to find a taxi to take us to Panjim after a 10 hour plus flight we decided to book a Marriott car. We arrived at Dabolim airport to find a very young looking Marriott Associate holding up a placard with a mis-spelled name.

Rooms are spacious but do insist on a decent view ( not of a wall or electricity pylons).  Breakfast can be an adventure if eating on the terrace - beware of greedy crows who are not shy when stealing your omlette...Food is pricey - you're better off having breakfast in the cafe rather than ordering room service.

The restaurants downstairs also open up to a nice outdoor and pool area facing the canal. The rooms are modern with wifi and an LCD TV. The size is also reasonable and the beds comfortable.

The hotel was undergoing some renovation, hence the reception was repositioned, but to be honest, if we hadn't known that, we'd have never realised the same. They did a fantastic job. Check in was quick, however we wanted a king bed and we were given twins, it took an hour or so for them to change the same, though in the same period we had lunch & the luggage was shifted.  The best thing about this hotel is the food. It's just an unbelievable spread. There must've been about 40 dishes during breakfast / lunch / dinner.

Let me make a candid confession. This is the first time I am authoring a review of a hotel. Being a Gold Elite member I have stayed at numerous Marriott properties but this one is quite simply the best. Right from the time we stepped off into the porch of the hotel till we departed everything exceeded our expectations. The only wrinkle in the experience was when the airport transfer we had booked failed to show up at the airport but the hotel gladly refunded the taxi fare.   The hotel has recently undergone a refurbishment and the rooms and facilities are top rate. Though the hotel lacks a beach you would never miss it because of the stunning views of the bay and the rather impressively proportioned infinity pool.

The rooms are very spacious, so are bathrooms with a king size bathtub. The furnishing were good with a lcd tv.   The hotel had made alternate arrangement with transport to Cidade do Goa for swimming.   The breakfast was excellent (complimentary) and so was the staff.

The hotel has a renovated wing that they opened up in June. Everything is sparkling, the room was lovely with a brilliant view.

"I would like to start by saying that I do not usually take time off to write reviews. The fact that I am writing this one should say a lot. I wanted a hotel in Goa that we would be comfortable in but 99% of the properties do not have two double beds in one room. I have two kids and the hotels I checked with had restrictions about the number of additional beds they could provide and some recommended that the kids sleep in the same bed. That helped me narrow the options to Marriott. Due to the renovations I was skeptical. Fortunately we got a nice room in the renovated wing. The service was impeccable. The kids and us were made to feel very comfortable.

Part of the hotel was undergoing renovations at that time but the service provided to us during our stay was really nice.

A variety of local fishes were kept which you can get cooked your way. Liked the tiger prawns batter fried with 'extreme long island ice tea' besides the sea.

Since the hotel is located 05 minutes from the main market of Panjim by vehicle, it makes sense to stay here and try local options.

It was very convenient to be on the beach as well, and we enjoyed taking walks on the pretty beach in such a peaceful atmosphere although it was not safe to swim in the sea due to the strong current.

We had a lovely 2 weeks at The Marriott in March. The hotel was spotless & our room (104) was cleaned twice daily by the wonderful housekeeping staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The lobby has recently been refurbished & looks spectacular. The refurb is still ongoing in another part of the hotel but it is hidden behind huge screens so doesnt spoil your enjoyment of this lovely hotel. We had a bay view room on the ground floor which looked out onto the Mandovi River. Service at breakfast could've been better on some morning but a quick word with the restaurant manager & this was resolved. The Azur Bar has also been refurbished & looks amazing. The bar staff were great & really helped make our stay a very pleasant one.

After a 10 hour flight arriving at the hotel early morning (way before check in time), the greeting by the reception staff was excellent,  Drink on arrival, relaxed check in with personal service and a room provided until our's would be ready.  After the reviews we'd seen, we opted to upgrade to a sea view with a patio which was worth every penny.  Great to relax outside our room watching the busy mandovi river both by day and night. At night made even more idyllic by the enigma themed music piped around the pool area.  ALL the staff at the hotel cannot do enough for you, and the pool gardens and setting are immaculate.

My favourite was the outdoor one by the pool over looking the river. The food is more expensive at the hotel but as you can pay about £8 for two three course meals down the road it is hardly surprising.

The ""best"" part of our package was the flexi credits - which enabled us to use these credits for things like car rental, laundry, cake shop goodies, massages and spa, etc - apart from paying for the meals as well. The package gave us Rs 4,000/- per day worth of flexi credits - a total of Rs 24,000 for our stay. Hence, we had the freedom to have the buffet - or -  have meals a la carte.  On the last day - we use up our remaining flexi credits by hiring the hotel Innova for airport drop off and some goodies from the cake shop.

"A two day conference took me to the Marriott in Panjim Goa.  Located 45 minutes by road from the Dabolim airport, the approach to the hotel may create misgivings on your choice of stay.  However on arrival you will discover a well laid out property along the Mandovi river (just where it meets the sea).   The lobby which is at the upper level is large airy and has a nice coffee shop facing the water.  A great place to spend some time nursing your favourite drink.  By Marriott standards the rooms are at best ordinary.  The hotel is laid out along a long axis, implying that moving from your room to other facilities involves long walks (through corridors) and often the use of lifts to access the same.  Level 1 in one lift would be level 2 in another and took me a better part of my…",Date of stay: May 2009,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Hotel Marriot Goa resort is situated in a scenic location along side the Arabian Ocean. While, you are in the heart of Panjim, capital of Goa, you also enjoy the splendid view of the sea. The day starts with morning walk on Miramar beach, a nice time in the swimming pool along-side the sea, with mouth-watering dishes on the restaurant along-side the swimming pool.   The main attractions of Goa, viz Calangute, Bagha are about 30 minutes. Dona Paula is hardly 5 minutes drive.

They even have an ice cream cart with a whole range of ice cream and toppings where you can make your own sundaes.  However the location was on the river Mandovi without its own beach.

The Marriott Resort at Goa is a beautiful resort and showers 5 Star Luxury on the guests. I stayed here with my Company group of about 40 people. The place is spread out in big land and tastefully decorated.  I liked the rooms which were nicely done and had all the facilities that one expects in a five star hotel. Even the conference hall is good one and has a balcony that gives a scenic view of the sea. The pool side is terrific with sea view and cool breeze of Arabian Sea caressing you. The staff used to constantly maintain the pool and clear any dirt that fell into the pool.   In the evening we had a small exclusive open bar at the poolside all to ourselves.

Have recently returned from a stay at the Goa Marriott and have mixed feelings about it. The hotel is nice in many respects and the staff are very helpful but there are a lot of features that merit clarification:- 1. The hotel is NOT a beach hotel. There is a nearby beach but noone uses it because of dangerous currents 2. There are no water sports as advertised. 3. Food and drink prices are horrendously expensive. Take a taxi ride into town and enjoy drinks at a fraction of the hotel prices and enjoy the local restaurants where prices are much lower. I recommend the Mandovi Hotel for drinks - cocktails are a third of the hotel prices and the atmosphere is truly colonial. 4. Dont change money at the Marriott. Go to Thomas Cook in town and get 6 rupees per pound extra. Believe me…,Date of stay: April 2009,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the best part of it was taking walks on the hotel parapet overlooking the choppy monsoon sea. The food was great and the service was out of the world.

The steam room has the words in an ""in an emergency -pull stop"" painted by hand directly on to the wall in a similar fashion to signs painted in Indian Railway compartments.

This year we went with our 6 year old daughter and weren’t quite as shocked and can only say that from walking up the reception area steps and being able to look out through the bar area to the Mandovi River made the flight more than worthwhile.

It's located directly at the channel (not the sea!) so you always have a nice breeze. Breakfast ist really stunning. A huge variety and high quality - throughout. The spa is nice as well.

If you want the beach then either take a hotel car out for the day and head south to Benaulim or Palolem for pristine, quiet beaches.

The Marriott's as good as you'll get in India, it doesn't feel as special as some of the other's in the Far East (like the incomparable JW Marriott in Phuket), but that's probably because of the slightly unfashionable location within Goa and the elongated shape of the hotel.

ROOMS: Big, but starting to need some renovation. Bathrooms are a bit small for the size of the room and have no bathtub.   RESTAURANTS: The restaurants are beautifully decorated and the food top quality. Ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and when back in Goa I will make sure to stop by even if not staying there.   AMENITIES: The pool was under renovation; the gym is quite small, but well ventilated. Does not have elyptical machines and…",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"My girlfriend & I stayed at the Marriott in February 2005 for 2 weeks. It was a wonderful vacation. The staff were always pleasant and so helpful from the beginning to the end of our holiday.   On arriving at the hotel, we were given a room which we didn't like very much - noise from a nearby air conditioning unit was loud. When I told one of the customer relation executives, she immediately showed us an alternative room which we preferred and our bags were transferred to the new room straight away.  The location of the hotel is convenient for access to Panaji. It will take at least 30 mins to walk into town. The market just behind the Thomas Cook building (on the main road into town) is worth visiting. It is vibrant and colourful. Edu's restaurant on the main road near to the…",Date of stay: February 2005,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"This hotel is absolutely fantastic and I have to say that I do not think the brochures do it justice. The reception is gorgeous and so spacious the rooms are huge with 2 double beds and are kept so clean, the pool is beautiful with the most comfortable sun beds I’ve ever laid on. The food is great with a wide range of cuisines available. The best thing about this hotel has to be the staff who are so friendly and will do anything for you. If they haven’t got something that you need they will even find a way of getting it for you. The hotel is also in a great location if you want to visit other parts of Goa as it is central so you can travel north, south, east and west easily. The best way to do this is by cab which will cost you around £10 for the day which means they take you to…",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in March 2004.  On entering Goa we initially thought ""what had we done"" as did many others on arriving.  However once we were away from the airport and on route we were starting to feel slightly better.  The overall feel of the hotel was fantastic.  The staff went out of their way to help you in any way they could.  Once the bar staff knew what you were drinking they would often offer you one whether it be by the pool or in the open air bar in the evening.  The pool was clean as was the surrounding pool side.  In fact I don't think there was anything untidy about the whole hotel.    We stayed in an upgraded room with a sea view.  This was a large room with two queen beds and had a large bathroom.    This hotel also has a gym and a beauty…",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in November 2003.    Stunning hotel.   Beautiful open air reception.  We stayed in a basic room. It was fantastic. Huge bed, nice seating area, excellent bathroom facilites, lovely view of garden and river. Excellent breakfast buffet, everything you could want.   Very good restaurants - chinese,fish, mediteranean - yummy cake shop. I suffered with a bad back whilst there, my husband asked reception if there was a doctor available, they immediately rang a doctor, my husband spoke to him.  The doctor arranged to send some painkillers to the hotel.   By the time we had had a drink and got back to our room the painkillers were on the bed.   Excellent staff. The hotel advertises there is a beach .    It isn't really a beach. The hotel is based on…",Date of stay: November 2003,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
